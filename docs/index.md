# Thoughts, Rambling, and Code
Sometimes all at once. This site is automatically rendered from markdown documents where I store notes, longform tutorials, and [[code_snippets_functions|code snippets and functions]].

Like any bioinformaticist worth their weight, I only want three things - power :muscle:, fame :star:, and well-designed datasets with proper controls and consistent quality :bar_chart:. Not particularly in that order.

This site is not going to help with any of that, but hey, it might be fun. **Fun**^they tell me!^ :tada:
