Sometimes, it's useful to look for known mutations in your scRNA-seq reads, especially if you expect a mutation to be present in certain populations and not others, e.g. an inducible model system or a recurrent tumor versus a diagnostic one.

This process is relatively simple, though somewhat annoying. Let us delve into that annoyance now.
