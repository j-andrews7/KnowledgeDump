  abstract = {The establishing of the first cancer models created a new perspective on the identification and evaluation of new anti-cancer therapies in preclinical studies. Patient-derived xenograft models are created by tumor tissue engraftment. These models accurately represent the biology and heterogeneity of different cancers and recapitulate tumor microenvironment. These features have made it a reliable model along with the development of humanized models. Therefore, they are used in many studies, such as the development of anti-cancer drugs, co-clinical trials, personalized medicine, immunotherapy, and PDX biobanks. This review summarizes patient-derived xenograft models development procedures, drug development applications in various cancers, challenges and limitations.},

  abstract = {Activation–induced cytidine deaminase (AID) converts cytidine to uridine at Immunoglobulin (Ig) loci, initiating somatic hypermutation and class switching of antibodies. In vitro, AID acts on single stranded DNA (ssDNA), but neither double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) oligonucleotides nor RNA, and it is believed that transcription is the in vivo generator of ssDNA targeted by AID. It is also known that the Ig loci, particularly the switch (S) regions targeted by AID are rich in transcription-generated DNA/RNA hybrids. Here, we examined the binding and catalytic behavior of purified AID on DNA/RNA hybrid substrates bearing either random sequences or GC-rich sequences simulating Ig S regions. If substrates were made up of a random sequence, AID preferred substrates composed entirely of DNA over DNA/RNA hybrids. In contrast, if substrates were composed of S region sequences, AID preferred to mutate DNA/RNA hybrids over substrates composed entirely of DNA. Accordingly, AID exhibited a significantly higher affinity for binding DNA/RNA hybrid substrates composed specifically of S region sequences, than any other substrates composed of DNA. Thus, in the absence of any other cellular processes or factors, AID itself favors binding and mutating DNA/RNA hybrids composed of S region sequences. AID:DNA/RNA complex formation and supporting mutational analyses suggest that recognition of DNA/RNA hybrids is an inherent structural property of AID.},

  abstract = {Increasingly invasive bladder cancer cells lines displayed insensitivity toward a panel of dietary-derived ligands for members of the nuclear receptor superfamily. Insensitivity was defined through altered gene regulatory actions and cell proliferation and reflected both reduced receptor expression and elevated nuclear receptor corepressor 1 (NCOR1) expression. Stable overexpression of NCOR1 in sensitive cells (RT4) resulted in a panel of clones that recapitulated the resistant phenotype in terms of gene regulatory actions and proliferative responses toward ligand. Similarly, silencing RNA approaches to NCOR1 in resistant cells (EJ28) enhanced ligand gene regulatory and proliferation responses, including those mediated by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) γ and vitamin D receptor (VDR) receptors. Elevated NCOR1 levels generate an epigenetic lesion to target in resistant cells using the histone deacetylase inhibitor vorinostat, in combination with nuclear receptor ligands. Such treatments revealed strong-additive interactions toward the PPARγ, VDR and Farnesoid X-activated receptors. Genome-wide microarray and microfluidic quantitative real-time, reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction approaches, following the targeting of NCOR1 activity and expression, revealed the selective capacity of this corepressor to govern common transcriptional events of underlying networks. Combined these findings suggest that NCOR1 is a selective regulator of nuclear receptors, notably PPARγ and VDR, and contributes to their loss of sensitivity. Combinations of epigenetic therapies that target NCOR1 may prove effective, even when receptor expression is reduced.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Human blood develops from self-renewing hematopoietic stem cells to terminal lineages and necessitates regulator and effector gene expression changes; each cell type specifically expresses a subset of genes to carry out a specific function. Gene expression changes coincide with histone modification, histone variant deposition, and recruitment of transcription-related enzymes to specific genetic loci. Transcriptional regulation has been mostly studied using in vitro systems while epigenetic changes occurring during in vivo development remain poorly understood. RESULTS: By integrating previously published and novel global expression profiles from human CD34+/CD133+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), in vivo differentiated human CD4+ T-cells and CD19+ B-cells, and in vitro differentiated CD36+ erythrocyte precursors, we identified hundreds of transcripts specifically expressed in each cell type. To relate concurrent epigenomic changes to expression, we examined genome-wide distributions of H3K4me1, H3K4me3, H3K27me1, H3K27me3, histone variant H2A.Z, ATP-dependent chromatin remodeler BRG1, and RNA Polymerase II in these cell types, as well as embryonic stem cells. These datasets revealed that numerous differentiation genes are primed for subsequent downstream expression by BRG1 and PolII binding in HSPCs, as well as the bivalent H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 modifications in the HSPCs prior to their expression in downstream, differentiated cell types; much HSPC bivalency is retained from embryonic stem cells. After differentiation, bivalency resolves to active chromatin configuration in the specific lineage, while it remains in parallel differentiated lineages. PolII and BRG1 are lost in closer lineages; bivalency resolves to silent monovalency in more distant lineages. Correlation of expression with epigenomic changes predicts tens of thousands of potential common and tissue-specific enhancers, which may contribute to expression patterns and differentiation pathways. CONCLUSIONS: Several crucial lineage factors are bivalently prepared for their eventual expression or repression. Bivalency is not only resolved during differentiation but is also established in a step-wise manner in differentiated cell types. We note a progressive, specific silencing of alternate lineage genes in certain cell types coinciding with H3K27me3 enrichment, though expression silencing is maintained in its absence. Globally, the expression of type-specific genes across many cell types correlates strongly with their epigenetic profiles. These epigenomic data appear useful for further understanding mechanisms of differentiation and function of human blood lineages.},

Ligation of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) on intestinal epithelial cells by bacterial products promotes epithelial cell proliferation, secretion of IgA into the gut lumen and expression of antimicrobial peptides. As described in this Review, this establishes a microorganism-induced programme of epithelial cell homeostasis and repair in the intestine. Dysregulation of this process can result in chronic inflammatory and over-exuberant repair responses, and it is associated with the development of colon cancer. Thus, dysregulated TLR signalling by intestinal epithelial cells may explain how colonic bacteria and inflammation promote colorectal cancer.},

  abstract = {In a search for mediators of the p53 tumor suppressor pathway, which induces pleiotropic and often antagonistic cellular responses, we identified the long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) NEAT1. NEAT1 is an essential architectural component of paraspeckle nuclear bodies, whose pathophysiological relevance remains unclear. Activation of p53, pharmacologically or by oncogene-induced replication stress, stimulated the formation of paraspeckles in mouse and human cells. Silencing Neat1 expression in mice, which prevents paraspeckle formation, sensitized preneoplastic cells to DNA-damage-induced cell death and impaired skin tumorigenesis. We provide mechanistic evidence that NEAT1 promotes ATR signaling in response to replication stress and is thereby engaged in a negative feedback loop that attenuates oncogene-dependent activation of p53. NEAT1 targeting in established human cancer cell lines induced synthetic lethality with genotoxic chemotherapeutics, including PARP inhibitors, and nongenotoxic activation of p53. This study establishes a key genetic link between NEAT1 paraspeckles, p53 biology and tumorigenesis and identifies NEAT1 as a promising target to enhance sensitivity of cancer cells to both chemotherapy and p53 reactivation therapy.},

Here we demonstrate that T cell differentiation results in long-range changes in the chromatin structure of effector cytokine genes, which persist in resting Th1 and Th2 cells in the absence of further stimulation. Differentiation of naive T helper cells into mature Th2 cells is associated with chromatin remodeling of the IL-4 and IL-13 genes, whereas differentiation into Th1 cells evokes remodeling of the IFNgamma but not IL-4 or IL-13 genes. IL-4 locus remodeling is accompanied by demethylation and requires both antigen stimulation and STAT6 activation.

Specifically, Burkitt's lymphoma cases show a homogeneously strong expression of TCL1, whereas diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, nodal marginal zone lymphoma, and splenic marginal zone lymphoma display a striking variability in the intensity of TCL1 staining. This was validated in two independent series. A Gene-Set Enrichment Analysis of the genes correlated with TCL1A expression found that variation in the level of expression of TCL1A was significantly associated with some of the most important gene signatures recognizing B-cell lymphoma pathogenesis and heterogeneity, such as germinal center, B-cell receptor, NF-κB (and its target genes), death, MAP kinases, TNFR1, TOLL, and IL1R. Additionally, TCL1 expression was correlated with shorter time to treatment in chronic lymphocytic leukemia cases and shorter lymphoma-specific survival in mantle cell lymphoma series, thus indicating the clinical and biological significance of TCL1 expression, and suggesting TCL1A as a potential therapeutic target.},

  abstract = {Kinase inhibitors targeting the B-cell receptor (BCR) are now prominent in the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). We have focused here on interleukin 4 (IL-4), a cytokine that protects normal and malignant B cells from apoptosis and increases surface immunoglobulin M (sIgM) expression on murine splenic B cells. First, we have demonstrated that IL-4 treatment increased sIgM expression in vitro on peripheral blood B cells obtained from healthy individuals. In CLL, IL-4 target genes are overexpressed in cells purified from the lymph nodes of patients compared with cells derived from matched blood and bone marrow samples. As for normal B cells, IL-4 increased sIgM expression on CLL cells in vitro, especially in samples expressing unmutated V-genes. IL-4–induced sIgM expression was associated with increased receptor signalling activity, measured by anti-IgM–induced calcium mobilization, and with increased expression of CD79B messenger RNA and protein, and the “mature” glycoform of sIgM. Importantly, the ability of the BCR-associated kinase inhibitors idelalisib and ibrutinib, approved for treatment of CLL and other B-cell malignancies, to inhibit anti-IgM–induced signalling was reduced following IL-4 pretreatment in samples from the majority of patients. In contrast to stimulatory effects on sIgM, IL-4 decreased CXCR4 and CXCR5 expression; therefore, CLL cells, particularly within the progressive unmutated V-gene subset, may harness the ability of IL-4 to promote BCR signalling and B-cell retention within lymph nodes. Effects of IL-4 were mediated via JAK3/STAT6 and we propose a potential role for JAK inhibitors in combination with BCR kinase inhibitors for the treatment of CLL.},

We reviewed frequent somatic mutations and mutations involving the B-cell pathways in MCL and discussed clinical trials that attempted to disrupt these gene pathways and/or epigenetic events. Recurrent gene mutations were discussed in the light of prognostic and therapeutic opportunity and also the challenges of targeting these lesions. Mutations in the ATM, CCND1, TP53, MLL2, TRAF2 and NOTCH1 were most frequently encountered in mantle cell lymphoma. Translational models should be built that would assess mutations longitudinally to identify important compensatory, pro-survival and anti-apoptic pathways and actionable genetic targets.},

  abstract = {The 86-kDa IE2 nuclear phosphoprotein encoded by the human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) major immediate-early (MIE) gene behaves as both a non-specific transactivator of viral and cellular gene expression and as a specific DNA-binding protein targeted to the cis-repression sequence (CRS) at the cap site of its own promoter/enhancer region. Although the IE2 protein produced in bacteria has been shown to bind to the 14-bp palindromic CRS motif and IE2 synthesized in vitro forms stable dimers in solution through the conserved C-terminus of the protein, there is no direct evidence as yet that the intracellular mammalian forms of IE2 do so. Here, we show that the intact HCMV IE2 protein both binds to CRS DNA and dimerizes in yeast cells. In a one-hybrid assay system, a GAL4/IE2 fusion protein expressed in yeast cells activated target HIS3 expression only when CRS sites were located upstream of the GAL1 minimal promoter, but failed to do so on mutant CRS sites, demonstrating a requirement for sequence-specific DNA-binding by IE2. Examination of a series of deletion and triple amino acid point mutations in the C-terminal half of IE2 mapped the domains required for DNA-binding in yeast to the entire region between codons 313 and 579, whereas in the previous in vitro study with truncated bacterial GST fusion proteins, it was mapped to between codons 346 and 579. Transient co-transfection assays with deleted IE2 effector genes in Vero cells showed that the extra segment of IE2 between codons 313 and 346 is also required for both autoregulation and transactivation activity in mammalian cells. In a two-hybrid assay to study IE2 self-interations, we generated both GAL4 DNA-binding (DB) and activation domain (A)/IE2 fusion proteins and showed that IE2 could also dimerize or oligomerize through the C-terminus of the protein in yeast cells. Domains required for this interaction were all mapped to within the region between codons 388 and 542, which is coincident with the domain mapped previously for dimerization by co-translation and immunoprecipitation in vitro. Comparison of the domains of the IE2 protein required for CRS binding and dimerization in yeast suggests that these activities correlate precisely with requirements for the negative autoregulation function of the IE2 protein in mammalian cells.},

Furthermore, FACT and histone H3.3, a hallmark of transcription-coupled histone turnover, are enriched at the V(D)J region, 5′ flanking sequence of the Sμ switch region and the light chain Jκ 5 segment region in the Ig loci. The regions with the most abundant deposition of FACT and H3.3 were also the most efficient targets of SHM.

NMC is driven by the creation of a translocation oncoprotein, BRD4-NUT, which blocks differentiation and drives growth of NMC cells. BRD4-NUT forms distinctive nuclear foci in patient tumors, which we found correlate with ∼100 unprecedented, hyperacetylated expanses of chromatin that reach up to 2 Mb in size. These “megadomains” appear to be the result of aberrant, feed-forward loops of acetylation and binding of acetylated histones that drive transcription of underlying DNA in NMC patient cells and naïve cells induced to express BRD4-NUT. Megadomain locations are typically cell lineage-specific; however, the cMYC and TP63 regions are targeted in all NMCs tested and play functional roles in tumor growth. Megadomains appear to originate from select pre-existing enhancers that progressively broaden but are ultimately delimited by topologically associating domain (TAD) boundaries. Therefore, our findings establish a basis for understanding the powerful role played by large-scale chromatin organization in normal and aberrant lineage-specific gene transcription.},

  abstract = {Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), the most common subtype of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, is clinically heterogeneous: 40\% of patients respond well to current therapy and have prolonged survival, whereas the remainder succumb to the disease. We proposed that this variability in natural history reflects unrecognized molecular heterogeneity in the tumours. Using DNA microarrays, we have conducted a systematic characterization of gene expression in B-cell malignancies. Here we show that there is diversity in gene expression among the tumours of DLBCL patients, apparently reflecting the variation in tumour proliferation rate, host response and differentiation state of the tumour. We identified two molecularly distinct forms of DLBCL which had gene expression patterns indicative of different stages of B-cell differentiation. One type expressed genes characteristic of germinal centre B cells ('germinal centre B-like DLBCL'); the second type expressed genes normally induced during in vitro activation of peripheral blood B cells ('activated B-like DLBCL'). Patients with germinal centre B-like DLBCL had a significantly better overall survival than those with activated B-like DLBCL. The molecular classification of tumours on the basis of gene expression can thus identify previously undetected and clinically significant subtypes of cancer.},

  abstract = {Translocations involving the BCL-6 gene are common in the diffuse large cell subtype of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Invariably, the BCL-6 coding region is intact, but its 5′ untranslated region is replaced with sequences from the translocation partner. The present study shows that BCL-6 expression is regulated in lymphocytes during mitogenic stimulation. Resting B and T lymphocytes contain high levels of BCL-6 mRNA. Stimulation of mouse B cells with anti-IgM or IgD antibodies, bacterial lipopolysaccharide, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate plus ionomycin, or CD40 ligand led to a five-fold to 35-fold decrease in BCL-6 mRNA levels. Similar downregulation of BCL-6 mRNA was seen in human B cells stimulated with Staphylococcus aureus plus interleukin-2 or anti-IgM antibodies and in human T lymphocytes stimulated with phytohemagglutinin. BCL-6 mRNA levels began to decrease 8 to 16 hours after stimulation, before cells entered S phase. Although polyclonal activation of B cells in vitro invariably decreased BCL-6 MRNA expression, activated B cells from human germinal centers expressed BCL-6 mRNA at levels comparable to the levels in resting B cells. Despite these similar mRNA levels, BCL-6 protein expression was threefold to 34-fold higher in germinal center B cells than in resting B cells, suggesting that BCL-6 protein levels are controlled by translational or posttranslational mechanisms. These observations suggest that the germinal center reaction provides unique activation signals to B cells that allow for continued, high-level BCL-6 expression.},

  abstract = {DNA methylation is responsible for regulating gene expression and cellular differentiation and for maintaining genomic stability during normal human development. Furthermore, it plays a significant role in the regulation of hematopoiesis. In order to elucidate the influence of DNA methylation during B-cell development, genome-wide DNA methylation status of pro-B, pre-BI, pre-BII, and naïve-B-cells isolated from human umbilical cord blood was determined using the methylated CpG island recovery assay followed by next generation sequencing. On average, 182–200 million sequences were generated for each precursor B-cell subset in 10 biological replicates. An overall decrease in methylation was observed during the transition from pro-B to pre-BI, whereas no differential methylation was observed in the pre-BI to pre-BII transition or in the pre-BII to naïve B-cell transition. Most of the methylated regions were located within intergenic and intronic regions not present in a CpG island context. Putative novel enhancers were identified in these regions that were differentially methylated between pro-B and pre-BI cells. The genome-wide methylation profiles are publically available and may be used to gain a better understanding of the involvement of atypical DNA methylation in the pathogenesis of malignancies associated with precursor B-cells.},

  abstract = {Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common cancer diagnosed in children under the age of 15. In addition to genetic aberrations, epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation are altered in cancer and impact gene expression. To identify epigenetic alterations in ALL, genome-wide methylation profiles were generated using the methylated CpG island recovery assay followed by next-generation sequencing. More than 25,000 differentially methylated regions (DMR) were observed in ALL patients with ∼90\% present within intronic or intergenic regions. To determine the regulatory potential of the DMR, whole-transcriptome analysis was performed and integrated with methylation data. Aberrant promoter methylation was associated with the altered expression of genes involved in transcriptional regulation, apoptosis, and proliferation. Novel enhancer-like sequences were identified within intronic and intergenic DMR. Aberrant methylation in these regions was associated with the altered expression of neighboring genes involved in cell cycle processes, lymphocyte activation and apoptosis. These genes include potential epi-driver genes, such as SYNE1, PTPRS, PAWR, HDAC9, RGCC, MCOLN2, LYN, TRAF3, FLT1, and MELK, which may provide a selective advantage to leukemic cells. In addition, the differential expression of epigenetic modifier genes, pseudogenes, and non-coding RNAs was also observed accentuating the role of erroneous epigenetic gene regulation in ALL.},

  abstract = {Histone lysine acetylation is critical in regulating transcription. Dysregulation of this process results in aberrant gene expression in various diseases, including cancer. The bromodomain, present in several proteins, recognizes promotor lysine acetylation and recruits other transcription factors. The bromodomain extra-terminal (BET) family of proteins consists of four conserved mammalian members that regulate transcription of oncogenes such as MYC and the NUT fusion oncoprotein. Targeting the acetyl-lysine-binding property of BET proteins is a potential therapeutic approach of cancer. Consequently, following the demonstration that thienotriazolodiazepine small molecules effectively inhibit BET, clinical trials were initiated. We thus discuss the mechanisms of action of various BET inhibitors and the prospects for their clinical use as cancer therapeutics., Addition of acetyl groups to histone proteins that are present in DNA is critical for proper copying of genetic information into producing proteins. This process is dysregulated in various diseases including cancer, resulting in continuous production of oncogenes – genes responsible for promoting cancer – such as NUT and MYC. Bromodomain extra-terminal (BET) proteins mediate acetyl addition, and as a result, transcription. BET inhibitors are small molecules that block the action of BET proteins and the transcription of oncogenes. In this review, we discuss the different available BET inhibitors, the way they act, and their potential use in clinical settings for cancer treatment.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Pathogenic somatic variants affecting the genes Histone 3 Family 3A and 3B (H3F3) are extensively linked to the process of oncogenesis, in particular related to central nervous system tumors in children. Recently, H3F3 germline missense variants were described as the cause of a novel pediatric neurodevelopmental disorder. We aimed to investigate patterns of brain MR imaging of individuals carrying H3F3 germline variants. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective study, we included individuals with proved H3F3 causative genetic variants and available brain MR imaging scans. Clinical and demographic data were retrieved from available medical records. Molecular genetic testing results were classified using the American College of Medical Genetics criteria for variant curation. Brain MR imaging abnormalities were analyzed according to their location, signal intensity, and associated clinical symptoms. Numeric variables were described according to their distribution, with median and interquartile range. RESULTS: Eighteen individuals (10 males, 56\%) with H3F3 germline variants were included. Thirteen of 18 individuals (72\%) presented with a small posterior fossa. Six individuals (33\%) presented with reduced size and an internal rotational appearance of the heads of the caudate nuclei along with an enlarged and squared appearance of the frontal horns of the lateral ventricles. Five individuals (28\%) presented with dysgenesis of the splenium of the corpus callosum. Cortical developmental abnormalities were noted in 8 individuals (44\%), with dysgyria and hypoplastic temporal poles being the most frequent presentation. CONCLUSIONS: Imaging phenotypes in germline H3F3-affected individuals are related to brain features, including a small posterior fossa as well as dysgenesis of the corpus callosum, cortical developmental abnormalities, and deformity of lateral ventricles.},

  abstract = {Multiple myeloma (MM) is a tumor of antibody producing plasmablasts/plasma cells that resides within the bone marrow (BM). In addition to the well-established role of genetic lesions and tumor-microenvironment interactions in the development of MM, deregulated epigenetic mechanisms are emerging as important in MM pathogenesis. Recently, MM sequencing and expression projects have revealed that mutations and copy number variations as well as deregulation in the expression of epigenetic modifiers are characteristic features of MM. In the past decade, several studies have suggested epigenetic mechanisms via DNA methylation, histone modifications and non-coding RNAs as important contributing factors in MM with impacts on disease initiation, progression, clonal heterogeneity and response to treatment. Herein we review the present view and knowledge that has accumulated over the past decades on the role of epigenetics in MM, with focus on the interplay between epigenetic mechanisms and the potential use of epigenetic inhibitors as future treatment modalities for MM.},

  abstract = {The biological role and therapeutic potential of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in multiple myeloma (MM) are still to be investigated. Here, we studied the functional significance and the druggability of the oncogenic lncRNA MALAT1 in MM. Targeting MALAT1 by novel LNA-gapmeR antisense oligonucleotide antagonized MM cell proliferation and triggered apoptosis both in vitro and in vivo in a murine xenograft model of human MM. Of note, antagonism of MALAT1 downmodulated the two major transcriptional activators of proteasome subunit genes, namely NRF1 and NRF2, and resulted in reduced trypsin, chymotrypsin and caspase-like proteasome activities and in accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins. NRF1 and NRF2 decrease upon MALAT1 targeting was due to transcriptional activation of their negative regulator KEAP1, and resulted in reduced expression of anti-oxidant genes and increased ROS levels. In turn, NRF1 promoted MALAT1 expression thus establishing a positive feedback loop. Our findings demonstrate a crucial role of MALAT1 in the regulation of the proteasome machinery, and provide proof-of-concept that its targeting is a novel powerful option for the treatment of MM.},

Recent studies on the molecular pathogenesis and biology of MM have highlighted a complex epigenomic landscape contributing to MM onset, prognosis and high individual variability.Areas covered: We describe here the current knowledge on epigenetic events characterizing MM initiation and progression, focusing on the role of DNA and histone methylation and on the most promising epi-therapeutic approaches targeting the methylation pathway.Expert opinion: Data published so far indicate that alterations of the epigenetic framework, which include aberrant global or gene/non-coding RNA specific methylation profiles, feature prominently in the pathobiology of MM. Indeed, the aberrant expression of components of the epigenetic machinery as well as the reversibility of the epigenetic marks make this pathway druggable, providing the basis for the design of epigenetic therapies against this still fatal malignancy.},

Work from the past decade has altered our perception of ncRNAs from 'junk' transcriptional products to functional regulatory molecules that mediate cellular processes including chromatin remodelling, transcription, post-transcriptional modifications and signal transduction. The networks in which ncRNAs engage can influence numerous molecular targets to drive specific cell biological responses and fates. Consequently, ncRNAs act as key regulators of physiological programmes in developmental and disease contexts. Particularly relevant in cancer, ncRNAs have been identified as oncogenic drivers and tumour suppressors in every major cancer type. Thus, a deeper understanding of the complex networks of interactions that ncRNAs coordinate would provide a unique opportunity to design better therapeutic interventions.},

  abstract = {Epigenetic alterations deregulate gene expression and are a significant contributor to cancer pathogenesis. Unlike gene mutations, epigenetic changes are reversible, and this distinction has been exploited therapeutically for Cutaneous T-cell Lymphomas (CTCL). Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) are FDA-approved; however, two-thirds of patients do not respond to HDACi. Therefore, we are addressing this gap by 1) establishing new techniques to identify HDACi response elements from all stages of CTCL and 2) developing targeted epigenetic modifiers (TEM) as a novel precision therapy. Our key innovations in this study are the generation of targeted epigenetic modifiers (TEM) as potential therapeutics and the development of a technique called Ultra-Low Input Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ULI-ChIP) that enables epigenome-wide profiling of histone modifications in 10,000–30,000 cells. We are utilizing this method to identify recurrently altered regulatory elements in HDACi-resistant CTCL patients, which, in conjunction with RNA-seq data, allow us to determine epigenomic and transcriptomic states that predispose patients for resistance to these treatments. We have identified several regulatory elements upstream of CXCR4, a chemokine receptor with known roles in cell survival and metastasis in B cell lymphomas and T cell leukemias, that are dysregulated in HDACi resistant patients. Similar loci were also found near key transcription factor (FOXP1) and anti-apoptotic genes (BCL2). The most promising HDACi response elements will be targeted in CTCL cells using locus-specific epigenetic modifiers to validate and evaluate the potential of each locus to be further developed for TEM protein therapeutics.},

  abstract = {Background Treatment for Cutaneous T Cell Lymphoma (CTCL) is generally not curative. Therefore, selecting therapy that is effective and tolerable is critical to clinical decision-making. Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi), epigenetic modifier drugs, are commonly used but effective in only \textasciitilde 30\% of patients. There are no predictive markers of HDACi response and the CTCL histone acetylation landscape remains unmapped. We sought to identify pre-treatment molecular markers of resistance in CTCL that progressed on HDACi therapy. Methods Purified T cells from 39 pre/post-treatment peripheral blood samples and skin biopsies from 20 patients were subjected to RNA-seq and ChIP-seq for histone acetylation marks (H3K14/9\,ac, H3K27ac). We correlated significant differences in histone acetylation with gene expression in HDACi-resistant/sensitive CTCL. We extended these findings in additional CTCL patient cohorts (RNA-seq, microarray) and using ELISA in matched CTCL patient plasma. Findings Resistant CTCL exhibited high levels of histone acetylation, which correlated with increased expression of 338 genes (FDR\,{$<$}\,0·05), including some novel to CTCL: BIRC5 (anti-apoptotic); RRM2 (cell cycle); TXNDC5, GSTM1 (redox); and CXCR4, LAIR2 (cell adhesion/migration). Several of these, including LAIR2, were elevated pre-treatment in HDACi-resistant CTCL. In CTCL patient plasma (n\,=\,6), LAIR2 protein was also elevated (p\,{$<$}\,0·01) compared to controls. Interpretation This study is the first to connect genome-wide differences in chromatin acetylation and gene expression to HDACi-resistance in primary CTCL. Our results identify novel markers with high pre-treatment expression, such as LAIR2, as potential prognostic and/or predictors of HDACi-resistance in CTCL.

  abstract = {The identification and cloning of the novel cytokine IL-15 were recently described. IL-15 is produced by a wide range of cell types, with the highest levels of IL-15 mRNA being detected in epithelial lines, monocytes, muscle, and placenta. Although it has no sequence identity with IL-2, IL-15 shares many of the T cell-stimulatory activities described for IL-2. We have examined IL-15 for its ability to stimulate B cells and have compared its activity with that of IL-2. IL-15 costimulates proliferation of B cells activated with immobilized anti-human IgM or phorbol ester, but has no stimulatory effect on resting B cells. In combination with recombinant CD40L, IL-15 is a potent inducer of polyclonal IgM, IgG1, and IgA secretion, but does not cause production of IgG4 or IgE. The activity of IL-15 in B cell proliferation and differentiation assays is comparable with that of IL-2. Studies that used neutralizing Abs have demonstrated that, for signal transduction in B cells, IL-15 uses the beta-chain of the IL-2R complex but, unlike IL-2, does not require the alpha-chain. IL-2 is required for the generation of a human primary Ag-specific in vitro response using sheep erythrocytes as Ag. Of all cytokines examined, only IL-15 has the capacity to replace IL-2 in this system, although only partially. In summary, IL-15 has comparable activity with IL-2 for the induction of B cell proliferation and differentiation and uses at least some of the components of the IL-2R complex to mediate its effects.},

Exploiting the fact that active promoters and enhancers are transcribed, we simultaneously measured their activity in 19 human and 14 mouse time courses covering a wide range of cell types and biological stimuli. Enhancer RNAs, then messenger RNAs encoding transcription factors, dominated the earliest responses. Binding sites for key lineage transcription factors were simultaneously overrepresented in enhancers and promoters active in each cellular system. Our data support a highly generalizable model in which enhancer transcription is the earliest event in successive waves of transcriptional change during cellular differentiation or activation. Uncaging promoter and enhancer dynamics In order to understand cellular differentiation, it is important to understand the timing of the regulation of gene expression. Arner et al. used cap analysis of gene expression (CAGE) to analyze gene enhancer and promoter activities in a number of human and mouse cell types.

  abstract = {After germinal center B cells undergo somatic mutation and antigen selection, they become either memory B cells or plasma cells, but the signal requirements that control entry into either pathway have been unclear. When purified human germinal center cells were cultured with interleukin-2, interleukin-10, and cells expressing CD40 ligand, cells with characteristics of memory B cells were generated. Removal of CD40 ligand from the system resulted in terminal differentiation of germinal center B cells into cells with the characteristics of plasma cells. These results indicate that CD40 ligand directs the differentiation of germinal center B cells toward memory B cells rather than toward plasma cells.},

  abstract = {In an effort to develop a molecular classification scheme for Crohn's disease (CD), mucosal biopsies from 69 CD patients and 28 normal controls were analyzed for expression of the RelA subunit of nuclear factor (NF)-B, A20 (a negative regulator of NF-B), polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and interleukin (IL)-8. Principal component analysis was used to classify individuals into three subsets based on patterns of biomarker expression. Set 1 included normal subjects and CD patients with mild disease and good responses to therapy, thus defining "normal" biomarker expression. CD patients in set 2, characterized by low expression of all five biomarkers, had moderate to severe disease and poor responses to immunosuppressive and anti-TNF therapy. Patients in set 3, characterized by low expression of RelA, A20, and pIgR, normal TNF and elevated IL-8, had acute inflammation that responded well to therapy. Classification of CD patients by these biomarkers may predict disease behavior and responses to therapy.},

  abstract = {SummaryBackground Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is a new human disease caused by a novel coronavirus (CoV). Clinical data on MERS-CoV infections are scarce. We report epidemiological, demographic, clinical, and laboratory characteristics of 47 cases of MERS-CoV infections, identify knowledge gaps, and define research priorities. Methods We abstracted and analysed epidemiological, demographic, clinical, and laboratory data from confirmed cases of sporadic, household, community, and health-care-associated MERS-CoV infections reported from Saudi Arabia between Sept 1, 2012, and June 15, 2013. Cases were confirmed as having MERS-CoV by real-time RT-PCR. Findings 47 individuals (46 adults, one child) with laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV disease were identified; 36 (77\%) were male (male:female ratio 3·3:1). 28 patients died, a 60\% case-fatality rate. The case-fatality rate rose with increasing age. Only two of the 47 cases were previously healthy; most patients (45 [96\%]) had underlying comorbid medical disorders, including diabetes (32 [68\%]), hypertension (16 [34\%]), chronic cardiac disease (13 [28\%]), and chronic renal disease (23 [49\%]). Common symptoms at presentation were fever (46 [98\%]), fever with chills or rigors (41 [87\%]), cough (39 [83\%]), shortness of breath (34 [72\%]), and myalgia (15 [32\%]). Gastrointestinal symptoms were also frequent, including diarrhoea (12 [26\%]), vomiting (ten [21\%]), and abdominal pain (eight [17\%]). All patients had abnormal findings on chest radiography, ranging from subtle to extensive unilateral and bilateral abnormalities. Laboratory analyses showed raised concentrations of lactate dehydrogenase (23 [49\%]) and aspartate aminotransferase (seven [15\%]) and thrombocytopenia (17 [36\%]) and lymphopenia (16 [34\%]). Interpretation Disease caused by MERS-CoV presents with a wide range of clinical manifestations and is associated with substantial mortality in admitted patients who have medical comorbidities. Major gaps in our knowledge of the epidemiology, community prevalence, and clinical spectrum of infection and disease need urgent definition. Funding None.},

All men born between 1929 and 1953 and diagnosed as having nonHodgkin's lymphoma in an area covered by eight cancer registries were considered eligible. Control subjects were identified by random-digit dialing from these same regions and were frequency-matched to men with lymphoma by age. Analyses of 1157 men with pathologically confirmed lymphomas and 1776 control subjects showed that the risk of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma was approximately 50\% higher among Vietnam veterans (odds ratio, 1.47; 95\% confidence interval, 1.1 to 2.0) compared with men who did not serve in Vietnam. Vietnam veterans were also at higher risk relative to (1) men who had not served in the military, (2) other veterans, and (3) other veterans who served between 1964 and 1972. An analysis of the military histories of the 232 Vietnam veterans suggested that the relative risk (1) increased with length of service in Vietnam (P.10), and (2) was higher among men in the sea-based Navy than among other veterans (P=.11). Little difference in risk, however, was noted according to dates of service, type of unit, military region, or any other characteristics that may have been associated with the use of Agent Orange. Although the cause remains uncertain, results of this study indicate that the risk of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is higher among Vietnam veterans than among other men.(Arch Intern Med. 1990;150:2473-2483)},

  abstract = {The discovery of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNA) has provided a new perspective on gene regulation in diverse biological contexts. lncRNAs are remarkably versatile molecules that interact with RNA, DNA, or proteins to promote or restrain the expression of protein-coding genes. Activation of immune cells is associated with dynamic changes in expression of genes, the products of which combat infectious microorganisms, initiate repair, and resolve inflammatory responses in cells and tissues. Recent evidence indicates that lncRNAs play important roles in directing the development of diverse immune cells and controlling the dynamic transcriptional programs that are a hallmark of immune cell activation. The importance of these molecules is underscored by their newly recognized roles in inflammatory diseases. In this review, we discuss the contribution of lncRNAs in the development and activation of immune cells and their roles in immune-related diseases. We also discuss challenges faced in identifying biological functions for this large and complex class of genes.},

  abstract = {Bioinformatics is now intrinsic to life science research, but the past decade has witnessed a continuing deficiency in this essential expertise. Basic data stewardship is still taught relatively rarely in life science education programmes, creating a chasm between theory and practice, and fuelling demand for bioinformatics training across all educational levels and career roles. Concerned by this, surveys have been conducted in recent years to monitor bioinformatics and computational training needs worldwide. This article briefly reviews the principal findings of a number of these studies. We see that there is still a strong appetite for short courses to improve expertise and confidence in data analysis and interpretation; strikingly, however, the most urgent appeal is for bioinformatics to be woven into the fabric of life science degree programmes. Satisfying the relentless training needs of current and future generations of life scientists will require a concerted response from stakeholders across the globe, who need to deliver sustainable solutions capable of both transforming education curricula and cultivating a new cadre of trainer scientists.},

Using functional genomic technologies in combination with clustered regularly-interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 genome editing and in vivo mouse modeling, we show that CEBPA is located in a 170-kb topological-associated domain that contains 14 potential enhancers. Of these, 1 enhancer located +42 kb from CEBPA is active and engages with the CEBPA promoter in myeloid cells only. Germ line deletion of the homologous enhancer in mice in vivo reduces Cebpa levels exclusively in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and myeloid-primed progenitor cells leading to severe defects in the granulocytic lineage, without affecting any other Cebpa-expressing organ studied. The enhancer-deleted progenitor cells lose their myeloid transcription program and are blocked in differentiation. Deletion of the enhancer also causes loss of HSC maintenance. We conclude that a single +42-kb enhancer is essential for CEBPA expression in myeloid cells only.},

High prognostic heterogeneity is observed among patients with DLBCL with long-term survival ranging from 30\% to more than 90\% according to clinic-biological prognostics such as the International Prognostic Index (IPI) and its subsequent revised variants. Recent advances in the understanding of DLBCL biology as cell-of-origin (COO) determination has led to significant improvement of prognostic tools but also shed light on new potential targeted compounds for specific DLBCL subtypes. First DLBCL subset has been designed germinal center B-cell like DLBCL (GCB) because it expresses genes characteristic of germinal center B cells. Second DLBCL subset has been designed activated B-cell like DLBCL (ABC) because it expresses genes upregulated in response to in vitro activation. In this review, we will present state-of-the-art treatment of DLBCL in young and elderly patients, recent results in dose-dense regimen as well as potential interest for high-dose therapy followed by autologous stem cell transplant. A special emphasis will be given to new treatment developments according to COO in DLBCL. In particular, we will focus on new drugs that might alleviate the worse prognosis associated to DLBCL ABC subtype in the near future.}

  abstract = {The transcription factor Myc is essential for the regulation of haematopoietic stem cells and progenitors and has a critical function in haematopoietic malignancies1. Here we show that an evolutionarily conserved region located 1.7 megabases downstream of the Myc gene that has previously been labelled as a ‘super-enhancer’2 is essential for the regulation of Myc expression levels in both normal haematopoietic and leukaemic stem cell hierarchies in mice and humans. Deletion of this region in mice leads to a complete loss of Myc expression in haematopoietic stem cells and progenitors. This caused an accumulation of differentiation-arrested multipotent progenitors and loss of myeloid and B cells, mimicking the phenotype caused by Mx1-Cre-mediated conditional deletion of the Myc gene in haematopoietic stem cells3. This super-enhancer comprises multiple enhancer modules with selective activity that recruits a compendium of transcription factors, including GFI1b, RUNX1 and MYB. Analysis of mice carrying deletions of individual enhancer modules suggests that specific Myc expression levels throughout most of the haematopoietic hierarchy are controlled by the combinatorial and additive activity of individual enhancer modules, which collectively function as a ‘blood enhancer cluster’ (BENC). We show that BENC is also essential for the maintenance of MLL–AF9-driven leukaemia in mice. Furthermore, a BENC module, which controls Myc expression in mouse haematopoietic stem cells and progenitors, shows increased chromatin accessibility in human acute myeloid leukaemia stem cells compared to blasts. This difference correlates with MYC expression and patient outcome. We propose that clusters of enhancers, such as BENC, form highly combinatorial systems that allow precise control of gene expression across normal cellular hierarchies and which also can be hijacked in malignancies.},

MEME output now contains sequence LOGOS for each discovered motif, as well as buttons to allow motifs to be conveniently submitted to the sequence and motif database scanning algorithms (MAST, FIMO and Tomtom), or to GOMO, for further analysis. GLAM2 output similarly contains buttons for further analysis using GLAM2SCAN and for rerunning GLAM2 with different parameters.

  abstract = {Mapping the chromosomal locations of transcription factors, nucleosomes, histone modifications, chromatin remodeling enzymes, chaperones, and polymerases is one of the key tasks of modern biology, as evidenced by the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) Project. To this end, chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) is the standard methodology. Mapping such protein-DNA interactions in vivo using ChIP-seq presents multiple challenges not only in sample preparation and sequencing but also for computational analysis. Here, we present step-by-step guidelines for the computational analysis of ChIP-seq data. We address all the major steps in the analysis of ChIP-seq data: sequencing depth selection, quality checking, mapping, data normalization, assessment of reproducibility, peak calling, differential binding analysis, controlling the false discovery rate, peak annotation, visualization, and motif analysis. At each step in our guidelines we discuss some of the software tools most frequently used. We also highlight the challenges and problems associated with each step in ChIP-seq data analysis. We present a concise workflow for the analysis of ChIP-seq data in Figure 1 that complements and expands on the recommendations of the ENCODE and modENCODE projects. Each step in the workflow is described in detail in the following sections.},

  abstract = {SOX11 overexpression in mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) has been associated with more aggressive behavior and worse outcome. However, SOX11 oncogenic pathways driving MCL tumor progression are poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that SOX11 binds to regulatory regions of 2 important genes for microenvironment signals in cancer: (C-X-C motif) chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) and PTK2 (encoding for focal adhesion kinase [FAK]). Moreover, SOX11+ xenograft and human primary MCL tumors overexpress cell migration and stromal stimulation gene signatures compared with their SOX11− counterparts. We show that SOX11 directly upregulates CXCR4 and FAK expression, activating PI3K/AKT and ERK1/2 FAK-downstream pathways in MCL. Concordantly, SOX11+ MCL cells have higher cell migration, transmigration through endothelial cells, adhesion to stromal cells, and cell proliferation and display an increased resistance to conventional drug therapies compared with SOX11− MCL cells. Specific FAK inhibition blocks downstream PI3K/AKT- and ERK1/2-mediated phosphorylation. Additionally, specific FAK and PI3K inhibitors reduce SOX11-enhanced MCL cell migration and stromal interactions and revert cell adhesion–mediated drug resistance (CAM-DR) to the same levels as SOX11− MCL cells. In intravenous MCL xenograft models, SOX11+ MCL cells display higher cell migration, invasion, and growth compared with SOX11-knockdown cells, and specific FAK and CXCR4 inhibitors impair SOX11-enhanced MCL engraftment in bone marrow. Overall, our results suggest that SOX11 promotes MCL homing and invasion and increases CAM-DR through the direct regulation of CXCR4 and FAK expression and FAK/PI3K/AKT pathway activation, contributing to a more aggressive phenotype. Inhibition of this pathway may represent an efficient strategy to overcome stromal-mediated chemotherapy refractoriness in aggressive MCL.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Cytokines are integral mediators for maintaining intestinal mucosal homeostasis, as well as prominent effector molecules during chronic gut inflammatory diseases. This review focuses on recent studies of the role of specific cytokines in mucosal immunity. RECENT FINDINGS: Dichotomous, or even opposing, functions have been described for several cytokines involved in intestinal innate immunity (most notably for members of the interleukin-1 family), which depend on the specific inflammatory conditions within the intestinal mucosa. For example, both interleukin-1α and interleukin-33 exhibit 'alarmin'-type properties that can signal tissue or cell damage, which further add to their well described proinflammatory roles. Costimulatory molecules of the tumor necrosis factor/tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily, such as TNF-like cytokine 1A and LIGHT, are actively involved in mucosal proinflammatory pathways, but also may exert protection against infectious agents to facilitate recovery from acute inflammation. Finally, innate lymphoid cells are increasingly recognized as important cellular sources of pivotal mucosal cytokines, including the interleukin-23/T helper 17 cytokine, interleukin-22. SUMMARY: Elucidating the complexity of cytokine signaling within the normal mucosa and during acute and chronic inflammation will be a pivotal step toward understanding the pathogenesis of immune-mediated gut diseases and developing effective therapies to treat them.},

Two and one-half days after transfection using the calcium phosphate technique, we extracted RNA from the entire cell population and analyzed it by the S1 nuclease hybridization assay. Transcripts were barely detectable when β-globin gene-plasmid recombinants were used. However, 200 times more β-globin gene transcripts were found when the β-globin gene recombinants also contained SV40 DNA, and 90\% of these transcripts (about 1000 per cell) had the same 5′ end as authentic rabbit globin mRNA. In the latter case, abundant production of β-globin protein was readily detected in a fraction of transfected cells by immunofluorescent staining. Enhancement of globin gene expression was dependent on SV40 sequences acting in cis, but independent of the viral origin of DNA replication. The enhancing activity was associated with the 72 bp repeated sequence element located at the beginning of the viral late gene region. Viral DNA fragments containing the transcriptional enhancer element could act in either orientation at many positions, including 1400 bp upstream or 3300 bp downstream from the transcription initiation site of the rabbit β-globin gene. These studies define a class of DNA elements with a mode of action that has not been heretofore described. The activation of genes by specific enhancer elements seems to be a widespread mechanism that may be used for the regulation of gene expression.},

We demonstrate the existence of an enhancer within a mouse immunoglobulin heavy chain gene. A DNA fragment located between the joining region and the switch recombination region in the intron upstream of the immunoglobulin μ constant region has been linked, in both orientations, to genes coding for rabbit β-globin or SV40 T antigen. This element enhances the number of correct β-globin gene transcripts by at least two orders of magnitude and also stimulates production of T antigen. It acts from several hundred to several thousand base pairs up or downstream of a promoter without amplifying template copy number. Of the various cell lines tested, the immunoglobulin gene enhancer functions only in lymphocyte-derived (myeloma) cells. We propose that this tissue-specific enhancer contributes to the activation of somatically rearranged immunoglobulin variable region genes and possibly to abnormal expression of other genes (e.g. c-myc) that become translocated to its domain of influence.},

  abstract = {While progress has been made in treating primary epithelial tumors, metastatic tumors remain largely incurable and still account for 85–90 \% of all cancer-related deaths. Interleukin-4 (IL4), a Th2 cytokine, and the IL4/IL4 receptor (IL4R) interaction have well defined roles in the immune system. Yet, IL4 receptors are over-expressed by many epithelial cancers and could be a promising target for metastatic tumor therapy. The IL4/IL4R signaling axis is a strong promoter of pro-metastatic phenotypes in epithelial cancer cells including enhanced migration, invasion, survival, and proliferation. The promotion of breast cancer growth specifically is also supported in part by IL4-induced glutamine metabolism, and we have shown that IL4 is also capable of inducing glucose metabolism in breast cancer cells. Importantly, there are several types of FDA approved medications for use in asthma patients that inhibit the IL4/IL4R signaling axis. However, these approved medications inhibit both the type I IL4 receptor found on immune cells, and the type II IL4 receptor that is predominantly expressed by some non-hematopoietic cells including epithelial cancer cells. This article reviews existing therapies targeting IL4, IL4R, or IL4/IL4R signaling, and recent findings guiding the creation of novel therapies that specifically inhibit the type II IL4R, while taking into consideration effects on immune cells within the tumor microenvironment. Some of these therapies are currently in clinical trials for cancer patients, and may be exploitable for the treatment of metastatic disease.},

The chromo domain of HP1 is necessary for both targeting and transcriptional repression. In the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, the correct localization of Swi6 (the HP1 equivalent) depends on Clr4, a homologue of the mammalian SUV39H1 histone methylase. Both Clr4 and SUV39H1 methylate specifically lysine 9 of histone H3 (ref. 6). Here we show that HP1 can bind with high affinity to histone H3 methylated at lysine 9 but not at lysine 4. The chromo domain of HP1 is identified as its methyl-lysine-binding domain. A point mutation in the chromo domain, which destroys the gene silencing activity of HP1 in Drosophila, abolishes methyl-lysine-binding activity. Genetic and biochemical analysis in S. pombe shows that the methylase activity of Clr4 is necessary for the correct localization of Swi6 at centromeric heterochromatin and for gene silencing. These results provide a stepwise model for the formation of a transcriptionally silent heterochromatin: SUV39H1 places a 'methyl marker' on histone H3, which is then recognized by HP1 through its chromo domain. This model may also explain the stable inheritance of the heterochromatic state.},

Inhibitors clustered according to their target profiles with stronger binding of aminobenzamides to the HDAC NCoR complex than to the HDAC Sin3 complex. We identified several non-HDAC targets for hydroxamate inhibitors. HDAC inhibitors with distinct profiles have correspondingly different effects on downstream targets. We also identified the anti-inflammatory drug bufexamac as a class IIb (HDAC6, HDAC10) HDAC inhibitor.

  abstract = {Background: B-lymphoma Moloney murine leukemia virus insertion region-1 (Bmi-1) acts as an oncogene in various tumors, and its overexpression correlates with a poor outcome in several human cancers. Ectopic expression of Bmi-1 can induce epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and enhance the motility and invasiveness of human nasopharyngeal epithelial cells (NPECs), whereas silencing endogenous Bmi-1 expression can reverse EMT and reduce the metastatic potential of nasopharyngeal cancer cells (NPCs). Mouse xenograft studies indicate that coexpression of Bmi-1 and H-Ras in breast cancer cells can induce an aggressive and metastatic phenotype with an unusual occurrence of brain metastasis; although, Bmi-1 overexpression did not result in oncogenic transformation of MCF-10A cells. However, the underlying molecular mechanism of Bmi-1-mediated progression and the metastasis of breast cancer are not fully elucidated at this time. Results: Bmi-1 expression is more pronouncedly increased in primary cancer tissues compared to matched adjacent non-cancerous tissues. High Bmi-1 expression is correlated with advanced clinicopathologic classifications (T, N, and M) and clinical stages. Furthermore, a high level of Bmi-1 indicates an unfavorable overall survival and serves as a high risk marker for breast cancer. In addition, inverse transcriptional expression levels of Bmi-1 and E-cadherin are detected between the primary cancer tissues and the matched adjacent non-cancerous tissues. Higher Bmi-1 levels are found in the cancer tissue, whereas the paired adjacent non-cancer tissue shows higher E-cadherin levels. Overexpression of Bmi-1 increases the motility and invasive properties of immortalized human mammary epithelial cells, which is concurrent with the increased expression of mesenchymal markers, the decreased expression of epithelial markers, the stabilization of Snail and the dysregulation of the Akt/GSK3β pathway. Consistent with these observations, the repression of Bmi-1 in highly metastatic breast cancer cells remarkably reduces cellular motility, invasion and transformation, as well as tumorigenesis and lung metastases in nude mice. In addition, the repression of Bmi-1 reverses the expression of EMT markers and inhibits the Akt/GSK3β/Snail pathway. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that Bmi-1 promotes the invasion and metastasis of human breast cancer and predicts poor survival. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

  abstract = {B lymphocytes are generally recognized as the essential component of humoral immunity and also a regulator of innate immunity. The development of B cells is precisely regulated by a variety of factors via different mechanisms, including cytokine/cytokine receptors, signal transduction molecules, and transcription factors. Recent findings suggest that epigenetic factors, such as DNA methylation, histone modification, and non-coding RNA, play critical roles in establishing B cell lineage–specific gene expression profiles to define and sustain B cell identity and function. Epigenetic modifications are also sensitive to external stimuli and might bridge genetic and environmental factors in the pathogenesis or control of B-cell-related immune disorders, such as autoimmune diseases, lymphoma, and leukemia. Better understanding of the epigenetic mechanisms for regulating B cell development and involving B cell abnormal differentiation and function will shed light on the design of new therapeutic approaches to B-cell-related diseases, and potential candidates of epigenetic modulators may be identified to target epigenetic pathways to prevent or treat B cell disorders. We summarize the relevance of epigenetic marks and landscapes in the stages of B cell development, discuss the interaction of the transcriptional networks and epigenetic changes, and review the involvement of epigenetic risk in the pathogenesis of B-cell-related diseases. Understanding how specific epigenetic alterations contribute to the development of B-cell-related autoimmunity and malignancies is instrumental to control B cell disorders.},

  abstract = {In addition to their role in humoral immunity, B lymphocytes are important antigen-presenting cells (APC). In the same way as other APC, B cells make cytokines upon activation and have the potential to modulate T cell responses. In this study, we investigated which mouse B cell subsets are the most potent cytokine producers, and examined the role of Toll-like receptors (TLR) in the control of secretion of IL-6, IL-10, IL-12 and IFN-γ by B cells. Production of some cytokines was restricted to particular subsets. Marginal zone and B1 cells were the predominant source of B cell IL-10 in the spleen. Conversely, follicular B cells were found to express IFN-γ mRNA directly ex vivo. The nature of the activating stimulus dramatically influenced the cytokine made by B cells. Thus, in response to combined TLR stimulation, or via phorbol esters, IFN-γ was secreted. IL-10 was elicited by T-dependent activation or stimulation through TLR2, 4 or 9. This pattern of cytokine expression contrasts with that elicited from dendritic cells. QRT-PCR array data indicate that this may be due to differential expression of TLR signalling molecules, effectors and adaptors. Our data highlight the potentially unique nature of immune modulation when B cells act as APC.},

We have generated high-resolution maps for the genome-wide distribution of 20 histone lysine and arginine methylations as well as histone variant H2A.Z, RNA polymerase II, and the insulator binding protein CTCF across the human genome using the Solexa 1G sequencing technology. Typical patterns of histone methylations exhibited at~promoters, insulators, enhancers, and transcribed regions are identified. The monomethylations of H3K27, H3K9, H4K20, H3K79, and H2BK5 are all linked to gene activation, whereas trimethylations of H3K27, H3K9, and H3K79 are linked to repression. H2A.Z associates with functional regulatory elements, and CTCF marks boundaries of histone methylation domains. Chromosome banding patterns are correlated with unique patterns of histone modifications. Chromosome breakpoints detected in T cell cancers frequently reside in chromatin regions associated with H3K4 methylations. Our data provide new insights into the function of histone methylation and chromatin organization in genome function.},

  abstract = {By phosphorylating elongation factors and the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II, the positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) is the critical kinase for transcription elongation and co-transcriptional processing of eukaryotic genes. It exists in inactive small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (7SK snRNP) and active (free P-TEFb) complexes in cells. The P-TEFb equilibrium determines the state of cellular activation, proliferation, and differentiation. Free P-TEFb, which is required for growth, can be recruited to RNA polymerase II via transcription factors, BRD4, or the super elongation complex (SEC). UV light, various signaling cascades, transcriptional blockade, or compounds such as hexamethylene bisacetamide (HMBA), suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA), and other histone deacetylase inhibitors lead to a rapid release of free P-TEFb, followed by its reassembly into the 7SK snRNP. As a consequence, transcription of HEXIM1, a critical 7SK snRNP subunit, and HIV is induced. In this study, we found that a bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) bromodomain inhibitor, JQ1, which inhibits BRD4 by blocking its association with chromatin, also leads to the rapid release of free P-TEFb from the 7SK snRNP. Indeed, JQ1 transiently increased levels of free P-TEFb and BRD4·P-TEFb and SEC·P-TEFb complexes in cells. As a consequence, the levels of HEXIM1 and HIV proteins rose. Importantly, the knockdown of ELL2, a subunit of the SEC, blocked the ability of JQ1 to increase HIV transcription. Finally, the effects of JQ1 and HMBA or SAHA on the P-TEFb equilibrium were cooperative. We conclude that HMBA, SAHA, and JQ1 affect transcription elongation by a similar and convergent mechanism.},

  abstract = {The β-globin enhancer, called locus control region (LCR), is required for high level expression of all b-type globin genes. The LCR is in physical proximity with the genes it controls, with contacts shifting from embryonic (ε) to fetal (γ) and finally to adult (δ and β) globin gene promoters during development. In prior studies we showed that forced chromatin contacts between the LCR and the β-globin promoter led to transcriptional activation, suggesting that LCR-promoter looping causally underlies β-globin transcription (Deng et al. Cell 2012). In these studies, the transcription co-factor Ldb1 was tethered to the β-globin promoter using artificial zinc finger (ZF) DNA binding proteins, to trigger the promoter-LCR interaction. We subsequently showed that tethering Ldb1 to the promoters of developmentally silenced embryonic or fetal globin genes reactivated their expression in adult erythroblasts in a manner dependent on looped contacts with the LCR (Deng et al. Cell 2014). This work established a novel strategy to raise fetal globin expression in patients with sickle cell anemia. To examine mechanistically the effects of chromatin looping on gene expression we performed single molecule RNA FISH experiments to precisely measure transcription output at individual alleles before and after enforced LCR-γ-globin looping. The experiments were carried out in primary human erythroblasts, which produce elevated levels of γ-globin when exposed to culture conditions. Preliminary data suggest that the majority of transcripts emerge from the β-globin gene with a smaller fraction of transcripts coming from the γ-globin gene as expected. Among cells producing any type of globin primary transcripts, a significant fraction (25\%-35\%) of cells co-express γ- and β-globin. Importantly, γ- and β-globin are frequently transcribed from the same allele. Forced juxtaposition of the LCR and the γ-globin promoter increases the number of alleles expressing only γ-globin while reducing the number of alleles expressing only the β-globin gene. This result is consistent with the γ- and β-globin genes competing for LCR activity, and emphasizes the usefulness of this approach in the context of sickle cell anemia in which not only elevated levels of fetal hemoglobin but also reduction of the mutant hemoglobin are desirable. Surprisingly, however, the proportion of alleles co-expressing γ-globin and β-globin remains largely constant. We are testing whether co-expression from the same allele is LCR independent. Finally, our studies suggest that LCR-promoter contacts increase the probability of transcription of a given allele. We will also present work addressing the critical question as to how alteration of chromatin architecture overcomes the action of transcriptional repressive complexes, such as Bcl11a, which normally maintain embryonic and fetal globin genes in a repressed state throughout adulthood. In sum, our studies produce a deeper understanding of the interplay of chromatin architecture and gene expression in a system that holds great potential for therapeutic application in patients with hemoglobinopathies.

  abstract = {The loss of anti-proliferative responsiveness in prostate cancer cell lines toward ligands for vitamin D receptor, retinoic acid receptors/retinoid X receptors and peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR)α/γ may entail underlying epigenetic events, as ligand insensitivity reflects significantly altered messenger RNA expression of corepressors and histone-modifying enzymes. Expression patterns were dependent on phases of the cell cycle and associated with repressed basal gene expression of vitamin D receptor and PPARα/γ target genes, for example CDKN1A [encodes p21(waf1/cip1)]. Elevated nuclear corepressor 1 (NCOR1) and nuclear corepressor 2/silencing mediator of retinoic acid and thyroid hormone receptor protein levels were detected in prostate cancer cell lines compared with non-malignant counterparts. Knockdown of the corepressor NCOR1 significantly elevated basal expression of a cohort of target genes, including CDKN1A. Both chemical [histone deacetylases inhibitor (HDACi)] and NCOR1 knockdown targeting enhanced anti-proliferative sensitivity toward PPARα/γ ligands in prostate cancer cell lines. Pursuing PPARα/γ signaling, microarray approaches were undertaken to identify pathways and genes regulated uniquely by a combination of PPARα/γ activation and HDAC inhibition. Again, HDACi and knockdown approaches demonstrated that elevated NCOR1 expression and activity distorted PPARα/γ gene targets centered on, for example cell cycle control, including CDKN1A and TGFBRAP1. Quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction validation and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays both confirmed that elevated NCOR1 disrupted the ability of PPARα/γ to regulate key target genes (CDKN1A and TGFBRAP1). Interrogation of these relationships in prostate cancer samples using principal component and partial correlation analyses established significant interdependent relationships between NCOR1–PPARα/γ and representative target genes, independently of androgen receptor expression. Therefore, we conclude that elevated NCOR1 distorts the actions of PPARα/γ selectively and generates a potential epigenetic lesion with diagnostic and prognostic significance.},

  abstract = {Post‐translational modifications of histone amino termini are thought to convey epigenetic information that extends the coding potential of DNA. In particular, histone lysine methylation has been implicated in conveying transcriptional memory and maintaining lineage fidelity. Here an analysis of histone lysine methylation in quiescent (G0) and cycling lymphocytes showed that methylation of histone H3 at lysines 4 (H3K4), 9 (H3K9), 27 (H3K27) and histone H4 at lysine 20 is markedly reduced in resting B lymphocytes as compared with cycling cells. Quiescent B cells also lacked heterochromatin‐associated HP1β and Ikaros at pericentric chromatin and expressed low levels of Ezh2 and ESET histone methyl transferases (HMTases). Nuclei from resting B or T cells were approximately three times more efficiently reprogrammed in nuclear transfer assays than cells in which HMTase expression, histone methylation and HP1β binding had been restored following mitotic stimulation. These results showing local and global changes in histone lysine methylation levels in vivo demonstrate that constitutive heterochromatin organization is modified in resting lymphocytes and suggest that histone hypomethylation is a useful indicator of epigenetic plasticity.},

Next-generation sequencing is providing a window for visualizing the human epigenome and how it is altered in cancer. This view provides many surprises, including linking epigenetic abnormalities to mutations in genes that control DNA methylation, the packaging and the function of DNA in chromatin, and metabolism. Epigenetic alterations are leading candidates for the development of specific markers for cancer detection, diagnosis and prognosis. The enzymatic processes that control the epigenome present new opportunities for deriving therapeutic strategies designed to reverse transcriptional abnormalities that are inherent to the cancer epigenome.},

We studied 127 patients (85 MF, 28 SS, five Sezary cell leukaemia, four lymphomatoid papulosis, and five unspecified cutaneous T-cell lymphomas (CTCL)) originating from Europe (France, Spain, U.K., Portugal) or from U.S.A. (California) for the presence of HTLV-I infection markers. HTLV-I and -II serology were performed on 78 patients using standard immunological methods. Reverse transcriptase (RT) assay was also performed in 26 cases using an RT-PCR-based method of high sensitivity. Molecular analyses were performed on 215 DNA samples (121 from fresh PBMCs, 26 from PBMCs after short-term culture and 68 from skin lesions) by PCR amplification using HTLV-I and -II gag, pol, env, pX and LTR specific primers. Immunological tests were negative except for two sera which were indeterminate. PCR with all HTLV-I and -II primer pairs showed negative results in all 215 samples investigated. No RT activity was detected in short-term PBMC cultures of any of the 26 cases studied. The results of this large study from five different countries clearly indicate that MF and SS are not associated with HTLV-I infection.},

  abstract = {DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) activate a canonical DNA damage response, including highly conserved cell cycle checkpoint pathways that prevent cells with DSBs from progressing through the cell cycle. In developing B cells, pre-B cell receptor (pre-BCR) signals initiate immunoglobulin light (Igl) chain gene assembly, leading to RAG-mediated DNA DSBs. The pre-BCR also promotes cell cycle entry, which could cause aberrant DSB repair and genome instability in pre-B cells. Here, we show that RAG DSBs inhibit pre-BCR signals through the ATM- and NF-κB2-dependent induction of SPIC, a hematopoietic-specific transcriptional repressor. SPIC inhibits expression of the SYK tyrosine kinase and BLNK adaptor, resulting in suppression of pre-BCR signaling. This regulatory circuit prevents the pre-BCR from inducing additional Igl chain gene rearrangements and driving pre-B cells with RAG DSBs into cycle. We propose that pre-B cells toggle between pre-BCR signals and a RAG DSB-dependent checkpoint to maintain genome stability while iteratively assembling Igl chain genes.},

Herein we show that the actions of EZH2 in driving GC formation and lymphoma precursor lesions require site-specific binding by the BCL6 transcriptional repressor and the presence of a non-canonical PRC1-BCOR-CBX8 complex. The chromodomain protein CBX8 is induced in GC B cells, binds to H3K27me3 at bivalent promoters, and is required for stable association of the complex and the resulting histone modifications. Moreover, oncogenic BCL6 and EZH2 cooperate to accelerate diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) development and combinatorial targeting of these repressors results in enhanced anti-lymphoma activity in DLBCLs.},

  abstract = {Summary The EZH2 histone methyltransferase is highly expressed in germinal center (GC) B cells and targeted by somatic mutations in B cell lymphomas. Here, we find that EZH2 deletion or pharmacologic inhibition suppresses GC formation and functions. EZH2 represses proliferation checkpoint genes and helps establish bivalent chromatin domains at key regulatory loci to transiently suppress GC B cell differentiation. Somatic mutations reinforce these physiological effects through enhanced silencing of EZH2 targets. Conditional expression of mutant EZH2 in mice induces GC hyperplasia and accelerated lymphomagenesis in cooperation with BCL2. GC B cell (GCB)-type diffuse large B cell lymphomas (DLBCLs) are mostly addicted to EZH2 but not the more differentiated activated B cell (ABC)-type DLBCLs, thus clarifying the therapeutic scope of EZH2 targeting.},

The histone chaperone complex facilitates chromatin transcription (FACT) is responsible for forming H3K4me3 at AID target loci. Here we show that the histone chaperone suppressor of Ty6 (Spt6) also participates in regulating H3K4me3 for CSR and for somatic hypermutation in AID target loci. We found that H3K4me3 loss was correlated with defects in AID-induced DNA breakage and reduced mutation frequencies in IgH loci in both S and variable regions and in non-IgH loci such as metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (MALAT1) and small nucleolar RNA host gene 3 (SNHG3). Global gene expression analysis revealed that Spt6 can act as both a positive and negative transcriptional regulator in B cells, affecting ∼5\% of the genes that includes suppressor of Ty4 (Spt4) and AID. Interestingly, Spt6 regulates CSR and AID expression through two distinct histone modification pathways, H3K4me3 and H3K36me3, respectively. Tandem SH2 domain of Spt6 plays a critical role in CSR and H3K4me3 regulation involving Set1 histone methyltransferase. We conclude that Spt6 is a unique histone chaperone capable of regulating the histone epigenetic state of both AID targets and the AID locus.},

  abstract = {Although gliomas are thought to arise from a neural-glial lineage of ectodermal origin, many gliomas express a mesenchymal signature. Behnan et al. review the origins of this signature in glioma: it may arise via the tumour stroma, via NF1-mutation in tumour cells and be influenced by the cell of origin, or arise in response to radiotherapy/chemotherapy/anti-angiogenic treatment., The complexity of glioblastoma multiforme, the most common and lethal variant of gliomas, is reflected by cellular and molecular heterogeneity at both the inter- and intra-tumoural levels. Molecular subtyping has arisen in the past two decades as a promising strategy to give better predictions of glioblastoma multiforme evolution, common disease pathways, and rational treatment options. The Cancer Genome Atlas network initially identified four molecular subtypes of glioblastoma multiforme: proneural, neural, mesenchymal and classical. However, further studies, also investigated glioma stem cells, have only identified two to three subtypes: proneural, mesenchymal and classical. The proneural–mesenchymal transition upon tumour recurrence has been suggested as a mechanism of tumour resistance to radiation and chemotherapy treatment. Glioblastoma multiforme patients with the mesenchymal subtype tend to survive shorter than other subtypes when analysis is restricted to samples with low transcriptional heterogeneity. Although the mesenchymal signature in malignant glioma may seem at odds with the common idea of the ectodermal origin of neural-glial lineages, the presence of the mesenchymal signature in glioma is supported by several studies suggesting that it can result from: (i) intrinsic expression of tumour cells affected with accumulated genetic mutations and cell of origin; (ii) tumour micro-environments with recruited macrophages or microglia, mesenchymal stem cells or pericytes, and other progenitors; (iii) resistance to tumour treatment, including radiotherapy, antiangiogenic therapy and possibly chemotherapy. Genetic abnormalities, mainly NF1 mutations, together with NF-κB transcriptional programs, are the main driver of acquiring mesenchymal-signature. This signature is far from being simply tissue artefacts, as it has been identified in single cell glioma, circulating tumour cells, and glioma stem cells that are released from the tumour micro-environment. All these together suggest that the mesenchymal signature in glioblastoma multiforme is induced and sustained via cell intrinsic mechanisms and tumour micro-environment factors. Although patients with the mesenchymal subtype tend to have poorer prognosis, they may have favourable response to immunotherapy and intensive radio- and chemotherapy.},

  abstract = {Oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) account for approximately 5\% of the adult brain and have been historically studied for their role in myelination. In the adult brain, OPCs maintain their proliferative capacity and ability to differentiate into oligodendrocytes throughout adulthood, even though relatively few mature oligodendrocytes are produced post-developmental myelination. Recent work has begun to demonstrate that OPCs likely perform multiple functions in both homeostasis and disease and can significantly impact behavioral phenotypes such as food intake and depressive symptoms. However, the exact mechanisms through which OPCs might influence brain function remain unclear. The first step in further exploration of OPC function is to profile the transcriptional repertoire and assess the heterogeneity of adult OPCs. In this work, we demonstrate that adult OPCs are transcriptionally diverse and separate into two distinct populations in the homeostatic brain. These two groups show distinct transcriptional signatures and enrichment of biological processes unique to individual OPC populations. We have validated these OPC populations using multiple methods, including multiplex RNA in situ hybridization and RNA flow cytometry. This study provides an important resource that profiles the transcriptome of adult OPCs and will provide a toolbox for further investigation into novel OPC functions.},

A continuum of transitional cell states exists between these discrete stages. We combine the depth of single-cell mass cytometry and an algorithm developed to leverage this continuum by aligning single cells of a given lineage onto a unified trajectory that accurately predicts the developmental path de novo. Applied to human B cell lymphopoiesis, the algorithm (termed Wanderlust) constructed trajectories spanning from hematopoietic stem cells through to naive B cells. This trajectory revealed nascent fractions of B cell progenitors and aligned them with developmentally cued regulatory signaling including IL-7/STAT5 and cellular events such as immunoglobulin rearrangement, highlighting checkpoints across which regulatory signals are rewired paralleling changes in cellular state. This study provides a comprehensive analysis of human B lymphopoiesis, laying a foundation to apply this approach to other tissues and “corrupted” developmental processes including cancer.},

We demonstrate that this is caused by aberrant recruitment of the PRC2 complex to K27M mutant H3.3 and enzymatic inhibition of the H3K27me3-establishing methyltransferase EZH2. By performing chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by next-generation sequencing and whole-genome bisulfite sequencing in primary pHGGs, we show that reduced H3K27me3 levels and DNA hypomethylation act in concert to activate gene expression in K27M mutant pHGGs.},

  abstract = {The B cell-associated surface molecule CD40 functions to regulate B cell responses. Cross-linking CD40 on B cells can lead to homotypic cell adhesion, IL-6 production, and, in combination with cytokines, to Ig isotype switching. Tyrosine kinase activity is increased shortly after engagement of this receptor. Little is known about how the very early events induced by CD40 cross-linking link to cellular responses. In this study, we demonstrate that nuclear factor (NF)-kappa B and NF-kappa B-like transcription factors are activated after cross-linking CD40 on resting human tonsillar B cells and on B cell lines. The activation is rapid and is mediated through a tyrosine kinase-dependent pathway. The complexes detected in electrophoretic mobility shift assays contain p50, p65 (RelA), c-Rel, and most likely other components. By using transient transfection assays, we found that cross-linking CD40 supports NF-kappa B-dependent gene expression. Our results define the NF-kappa B system as an intermediate event in CD40 signaling and suggest that the CD40 pathway can influence the expression of B cell-associated genes with NF-kappa B consensus sites.},

Although initially considered nonfunctional elements (the dark matter), recent evidence suggests that noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) play major roles in cellular biology and their deregulation is associated with human diseases. Although most of the attention has focused on short ncRNAs, such as microRNAs, the functional relevance of other ncRNAs, such as long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) is also gaining prominence. In this chapter we will tackle the biology of lncRNAs and their regulatory and structural roles in human development and cell differentiation. Given the functional versatility of lncRNAs, the chapter will focus on their roles in the regulation of mRNA transcription, mRNA splicing and maturation, epigenetic regulation, telomere stability, genomic imprinting, or formation of nuclear compartments, among others. Finally, as lncRNA deregulation is associated with human disorders we will discuss their potential uses as diagnostic and prognostic markers or therapeutic targets.},

We now report that the T-cell receptor (TCR) of the CD4(+) CTCL cells is triggered after interaction with DCs loaded with apoptotic CTCL cells, as shown by reduced membrane expression of CD3 and the TCR, up-regulation of cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4), and calcium mobilization. CTCL cells adopt a T-regulatory (Treg) phenotype expressing CD25/CTLA-4 and FoxP3 and secreting interleukin-10 (IL-10) and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta). Treg CTCL cells suppress normal T-cell antigen-driven secretion of IL-2 and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma). Blocking DC MHC class 2 expression or transport inhibited CTCL cell adoption of a Treg phenotype. Allogeneic CTCL cells or normal CD4 T cells served as sources of apoptotic material for CTCL cell conversion to a Treg phenotype. Conversion of CTCL cells to Treg cells may explain the anergic, immunosuppressive nature of the malignancy.},

Significant changes in DNA methylation in KMT2Ar ALL were identified in 2,545 CpG loci, influenced by age and the translocation partners AFF1 and MLLT1. In KMT2Ar ALL, DNA methylation loss was enriched at enhancers and for certain transcription factor binding sites such as BCL11A, EBF, and MEF2A.

  abstract = {Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are pattern recognition receptors that trigger innate immunity. In this study we investigated the expression of 10 TLRs in human naive and memory B-cell subsets. We report that in human naive B cells most TLRs are expressed at low to undetectable levels, but the expression of TLR9 and TLR10 is rapidly induced following B-cell-receptor (BCR) triggering. In contrast, memory B cells express several TLRs at constitutively high levels. The differential expression of TLR9 correlates with responsiveness to its agonist, CpG DNA. Thus, human memory B cells proliferate and differentiate to immunoglobulin (Ig)–secreting cells in response to CpG, while naive B do so only if simultaneously triggered through the BCR. The BCR-induced expression of TLRs in human naive B cells prevents polyclonal activation in a primary response, because it restricts stimulation to antigen-specific B cells. In contrast, the constitutive expression of TLRs in memory B cells allows polyclonal activation of the entire memory pool. Thus, in human B cells TLRs are downstream of BCR and play a role both in the primary response and in the memory phase.},

Here we report three new loci at 3p24.1 (rs9880772, EOMES, P=2.55 × 10(-11)), 6p25.2 (rs73718779, SERPINB6, P=1.97 × 10(-8)) and 3q28 (rs9815073, LPP, P=3.62 × 10(-8)), as well as a new independent SNP at the known 2q13 locus (rs9308731, BCL2L11, P=1.00 × 10(-11)) in the combined analysis. We find suggestive evidence (P{$<$}5 × 10(-7)) for two additional new loci at 4q24 (rs10028805, BANK1, P=7.19 × 10(-8)) and 3p22.2 (rs1274963, CSRNP1, P=2.12 × 10(-7)). Pathway analyses of new and known CLL loci consistently show a strong role for apoptosis, providing further evidence for the importance of this biological pathway in CLL susceptibility.},

  abstract = {The most highly conserved noncoding elements (HCNEs) in mammalian genomes cluster within regions enriched for genes encoding developmentally important transcription factors (TFs). This suggests that HCNE-rich regions may contain key regulatory controls involved in development. We explored this by examining histone methylation in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells across 56 large HCNE-rich loci. We identified a specific modification pattern, termed “bivalent domains,” consisting of large regions of H3 lysine 27 methylation harboring smaller regions of H3 lysine 4 methylation. Bivalent domains tend to coincide with TF genes expressed at low levels. We propose that bivalent domains silence developmental genes in ES cells while keeping them poised for activation. We also found striking correspondences between genome sequence and histone methylation in ES cells, which become notably weaker in differentiated cells. These results highlight the importance of DNA sequence in defining the initial epigenetic landscape and suggest a novel chromatin-based mechanism for maintaining pluripotency.},

Here we present high-resolution analyses of somatic copy-number alterations (SCNAs) from 3,131 cancer specimens, belonging largely to 26 histological types. We identify 158 regions of focal SCNA that are altered at significant frequency across several cancer types, of which 122 cannot be explained by the presence of a known cancer target gene located within these regions. Several gene families are enriched among these regions of focal SCNA, including the BCL2 family of apoptosis regulators and the NF-κΒ pathway. We show that cancer cells containing amplifications surrounding the MCL1 and BCL2L1 anti-apoptotic genes depend on the expression of these genes for survival. Finally, we demonstrate that a large majority of SCNAs identified in individual cancer types are present in several cancer types.},

  abstract = {Hematopoietic cancers are often initiated by deregulation of the transcriptional machinery. Prominent among such regulators are the sequence-specific DNA-binding transcription factors (TFs), which bind to enhancer and promoter elements in the genome to control gene expression through the recruitment of cofactors. Remarkably, perturbing the function of even a single TF or cofactor can modulate the active enhancer landscape of a cell; conversely, knowledge of the enhancer configuration can be used to discover functionally important TFs in a given cellular process. Our expanding insight into enhancer function can be attributed to the emergence of genome-scale measurements of enhancer activity, which can be applied to virtually any cell type to expose regulatory mechanisms. Such approaches are beginning to reveal the abnormal enhancer configurations present in cancer cells, thereby providing a framework for understanding how transcriptional dysregulation can lead to malignancy. Here, we review the evidence for alterations in enhancer landscapes contributing to the pathogenesis of leukemia, a malignancy in which enhancer-binding proteins and enhancer DNA itself are altered via genetic mutation. We will also highlight examples of small molecules that reprogram the enhancer landscape of leukemia cells in association with therapeutic benefit.},

  abstract = {HOTAIR (HOX antisense intergenic RNA) is a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) that is transcribed from the antisense strand of homeobox C gene locus in chromosome 12. HOTAIR coordinates with chromatin-modifying enzymes and regulates gene silencing. It is overexpressed in various carcinomas including breast cancer. Herein, we demonstrated that HOTAIR is crucial for cell growth and viability and its knockdown induced apoptosis in breast cancer cells. We also demonstrated that HOTAIR is transcriptionally induced by estradiol (E2). Its promoter contains multiple functional estrogen response elements (EREs). Estrogen receptors (ERs) along with various ER coregulators such as histone methylases MLL1 (mixed lineage leukemia 1) and MLL3 and CREB-binding protein/p300 bind to the promoter of HOTAIR in an E2-dependent manner. Level of histone H3 lysine-4 trimethylation, histone acetylation, and RNA polymerase II recruitment is enriched at the HOTAIR promoter in the presence of E2. Knockdown of ERs and MLLs downregulated the E2-induced HOTAIR expression. Thus, similar to protein-coding gene transcription, E2-induced transcription of antisense transcript HOTAIR is coordinated via ERs and ER coregulators, and this mechanism of HOTAIR overexpression potentially contributes towards breast cancer progression.},

  abstract = {Human tumor cell lines are extremely important tools for cancer research, but a significant percentage is cross-contaminated with other cells. Short tandem repeat (STR) profiling is the prevailing standard for authenticating cell lines that originate from human tissues. Based on the analysis of 482 different human tumor cell lines used in China by STR, up to 96 cell lines were misidentified. More importantly, the study has found that STR profiling alone is insufficient to exclude inter-species cross-contamination of human cell lines. Among the 386 cell lines which had a correct STR profile, 3 of them were inter-species cross-contaminated. Careful microscopic examination may be helpful in some cases to detect changes in morphology but additional testing is needed. Additionally, species verification by PCR could easily identify the contaminants, even with a low percentage of contaminating cells. Combining STR profiling with species identification by PCR, more than 20.5\% (99/482) of tumor cell lines were revealed as having been incorrectly identified, including intra-species (14.5\%), inter-species (4.4\%) cross-contamination and contaminating cell lines (1.7\%). Therefore, quality control of cell lines is a systemic issue. Each cell line should undergo a full QA (Quality Assurance) assessment before it is used for research.},

  abstract = {We report the generation and analysis of functional data from multiple, diverse experiments performed on a targeted 1\% of the human genome as part of the pilot phase of the ENCODE Project. These data have been further integrated and augmented by a number of evolutionary and computational analyses. Together, our results advance the collective knowledge about human genome function in several major areas. First, our studies provide convincing evidence that the genome is pervasively transcribed, such that the majority of its bases can be found in primary transcripts, including non-protein-coding transcripts, and those that extensively overlap one another. Second, systematic examination of transcriptional regulation has yielded new understanding about transcription start sites, including their relationship to specific regulatory sequences and features of chromatin accessibility and histone modification. Third, a more sophisticated view of chromatin structure has emerged, including its inter-relationship with DNA replication and transcriptional regulation. Finally, integration of these new sources of information, in particular with respect to mammalian evolution based on inter- and intra-species sequence comparisons, has yielded new mechanistic and evolutionary insights concerning the functional landscape of the human genome. Together, these studies are defining a path for pursuit of a more comprehensive characterization of human genome function.},

  abstract = {Super-enhancers are compound regulatory elements that control expression of key cell identity genes. They recruit high levels of tissue-specific transcription factors and co-activators such as the Mediator complex and contact target gene promoters with high frequency. Most super-enhancers contain multiple constituent regulatory elements, but it is unclear whether these elements have distinct roles in activating target gene expression. Here, by rebuilding the endogenous multipartite α-globin super-enhancer, we show that it contains bioinformatically equivalent but functionally distinct element types: classical enhancers and facilitator elements. Facilitators have no intrinsic enhancer activity, yet in their absence, classical enhancers are unable to fully upregulate their target genes. Without facilitators, classical enhancers exhibit reduced Mediator recruitment, enhancer RNA transcription, and enhancer-promoter interactions. Facilitators are interchangeable but display functional hierarchy based on their position within a multipartite enhancer. Facilitators thus play an important role in potentiating the activity of classical enhancers and ensuring robust activation of target genes.},

  abstract = {Mutations of the tumor suppressor p53 lead to chemotherapy resistance and a dismal prognosis in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Whereas p53 targets are used to identify patient subgroups with impaired p53 function, a comprehensive assessment of non-coding RNA targets of p53 in CLL is missing. We exploited the impaired transcriptional activity of mutant p53 to map out p53 targets in CLL by small RNA sequencing. We describe the landscape of p53-dependent microRNA/non-coding RNA induced in response to DNA damage in CLL. Besides the key p53 target miR-34a, we identify a set of p53-dependent microRNAs (miRNAs; miR-182-5p, miR-7-5p and miR-320c/d). In addition to miRNAs, the long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) nuclear enriched abundant transcript 1 (NEAT1) and long intergenic non-coding RNA p21 (lincRNA-p21) are induced in response to DNA damage in the presence of functional p53 but not in CLL with p53 mutation. Induction of NEAT1 and lincRNA-p21 are closely correlated to the induction of cell death after DNA damage. We used isogenic lymphoma cell line models to prove p53 dependence of NEAT1 and lincRNA-p21. The current work describes the p53-dependent miRNome and identifies lncRNAs NEAT1 and lincRNA-p21 as novel elements of the p53-dependent DNA damage response machinery in CLL and lymphoma.},

  abstract = {In a classical dogma, pathogens are sensed (via recognition of Pathogen Associated Molecular Patterns (PAMPs)) by innate immune cells that in turn activate adaptive immune cells. However, recent data showed that TLRs (Toll Like Receptors), the most characterized class of Pattern Recognition Receptors, are also expressed by adaptive immune B cells. B cells play an important role in protective immunity essentially by differentiating into antibody-secreting cells (ASC). This differentiation requires at least two signals: the recognition of an antigen by the B cell specific receptor (BCR) and a T cell co-stimulatory signal provided mainly by CD154/CD40L acting on CD40. In order to better understand interactions of innate and adaptive B cell stimulatory signals, we evaluated the outcome of combinations of TLRs, BCR and/or CD40 stimulation. For this purpose, mouse spleen B cells were activated with synthetic TLR agonists, recombinant mouse CD40L and agonist anti-BCR antibodies. As expected, TLR agonists induced mouse B cell proliferation and activation or differentiation into ASC. Interestingly, addition of CD40 signal to TLR agonists stimulated either B cell proliferation and activation (TLR3, TLR4, and TLR9) or differentiation into ASC (TLR1/2, TLR2/6, TLR4 and TLR7). Addition of a BCR signal to CD40L and either TLR3 or TLR9 agonists did not induce differentiation into ASC, which could be interpreted as an entrance into the memory pathway. In conclusion, our results suggest that PAMPs synergize with signals from adaptive immunity to regulate B lymphocyte fate during humoral immune response.},

  abstract = {Summary Lymphopoiesis requires the activation of lineage-specific genes embedded in naive, inaccessible chromatin or in primed, accessible chromatin. The mechanisms responsible for de novo gain of chromatin accessibility, known as “pioneer” function, remain poorly defined. Here, we showed that the EBF1 C-terminal domain (CTD) is required for the regulation of a specific gene set involved in B cell fate decision and differentiation, independently of activation and repression functions. Using genome-wide analysis of DNaseI hypersensitivity and DNA methylation in multipotent Ebf1−/− progenitors and derivative EBF1wt- or EBF1ΔC-expressing cells, we found that the CTD promoted chromatin accessibility and DNA demethylation in previously naive chromatin. The CTD allowed EBF1 to bind at inaccessible genomic regions that offer limited co-occupancy by~other transcription factors, whereas the CTD was dispensable for EBF1 binding at regions that are occupied by multiple transcription factors. Thus, the CTD enables EBF1 to confer permissive lineage-specific changes in progenitor chromatin landscape.},

  abstract = {Medulloblastoma is the most frequent malignant pediatric brain tumor and is divided into at least four subgroups known as Wnt, SHH, Group 3 and Group 4. Here we characterized gene regulation mechanisms in the most aggressive subtype, Group 3 tumors, through genome-wide chromatin and expression profiling. Our results show that most active distal sites in these tumors are occupied by the transcription factor OTX2. Highly active OTX2 bound enhancers are often arranged as clusters of adjacent peaks and are also bound by the transcription factor NEUROD1. These sites are responsive to OTX2 and NEUROD1 knockdown and could also be generated de novo upon ectopic OTX2 expression in primary cells, showing that OTX2 cooperates with NEUROD1 and plays a major role in maintaining and possibly establishing regulatory elements as a pioneer factor. Among OTX2 target genes we identified the kinase NEK2, whose knockdown and pharmacological inhibition decreased cell viability. Our studies thus show that OTX2 controls the regulatory landscape of Group 3 medulloblastoma through cooperative activity at enhancer elements and contributes to the expression of critical target genes.},

RUNX1 is expressed in mature resting B cells but proliferating B cell lines express RUNX3. Repression of RUNX1 by RUNX3 is required to allow the cell proliferation and this provides an experimental system to investigate the mechanism of the different activities of RUNX1 and RUNX3 in these cells.

  abstract = {The palatine tonsils, and particularly the nasopharyngeal tonsil (adenoid), may be functionally comparable to nasal-associated lymphoid tissue in rodents. Primary follicles occur in human tonsils at 16 weeks' gestation, and formation of germinal centres (GC) takes place shortly after birth. The GC arise in T-cell-dependent B-cell responses and are associated with: i) clonal expansion; ii) somatic hypermutation in immunoglobulin variable (Ig V)-region genes; iii) positive selection of B cells based on affinity for antigen; iv) differentiation to memory B cells and plasma cells; and v) induction of the J-chain gene. The follicular dendritic cells (FDC) of GC retain native antigen which stimulates growth of B-cell blasts and hypermutation of their Ig V genes. The resulting centrocytes die by apoptosis unless they are selected by antigen. Cognate interaction between CD4+ helper T cells and B cells is important to promote downstream switching of the heavy chain constant (CH) genes. In human tonsillar GC this process normally gives rise mainly to IgG (55\%-72\%) and IgA (13\%-18\%) immunocytes, both isotypes normally being partially associated with J-chain expression (36\% and 29\%, respectively). Because J chain is a key peptide in secretory IgA, tonsillar GC may contribute precursor cells to mucosal effector sites. Thus, mucosal immunity can be induced in the airways by nasal immunization, and the level of nasopharyngeal and salivary secretory IgA is decreased after adenotonsillectomy.},

  abstract = {Secretory immunity is the best-defined part of the mucosal immune system. This adaptive humoral defense mechanism depends on a fine-tuned cooperation between secretory epithelia and local plasma cells. Such mucosal immunocytes produce preferentially dimers and larger polymers of immunoglobulin A (collectively called pIgA), which contain J chain and therefore can bind to the epithelial secretory component (SC). This transmembrane glycoprotein functions as pIg receptor (pIgR) that also translocates pentameric IgM to the epithelial surface. B cells with a high level of J-chain expression and pIg-pIgR interactions at mucosal effector sites are thus necessary for the generation of secretory antibodies (SIgA and SIgM). Secretory antibodies perform immune exclusion in a first-line defense, thereby counteracting microbial colonization and mucosal penetration of soluble antigens. However, local production of pIgA is significantly down-regulated in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), as revealed by strikingly decreased J-chain expression. Although the total increase of the immunocyte population in IBD lesions probably compensates for the relatively reduced pIgA production, decreased pIgR/SC expression in regenerating and dysplastic epithelium signifies that the SIgA system is topically deficient. There is, moreover, a significant shift from IgA2 to IgA1 production, the latter subclass being less resistant to proteolytic degradation. These changes—together with activation of mucosal macrophages and a dramatic increase of IgG-producing cells—may reflect local establishment of a second defense line which, however, is unsuccessful in its attempt to eliminate antigens derived from the indigenous microbial flora. Such a ‘frustrated’ local humoral immune system results in altered immunological homeostasis and jeopardized mucosal integrity. Complement activation observed in relation to epithelium-bound IgG1 in ulcerative colitis indicates, moreover, that the surface epithelium is subjected to immunological attack by an autoimmune reaction. These luminal deposits regularly contain terminal cytotoxic complement, and often also C3b as a sign of persistent activation. Comparison of identical twins, discordant with regard to ulcerative colitis, suggests that the markedly skewed local IgG1 response seen in this IBD entity may be genetically determined. The initial event(s) eliciting B-cell driven immunopathology in IBD remains unknown. Abrogation of oral tolerance to certain antigens from commensal bacteria has been suggested as a putative early mechanism, and lymphoid neogenesis and hyperplasia in the lesions most likely signify massive microbial overstimulation of the local B-cell system. Such ectopic lymphoid microcompartments may contribute substantially to the proinflammatory systemic-type of B-cell responses occurring in established IBD lesions.},

We identified 12 major classes that are organized as \textasciitilde 600 distinct cell states, which map to precise spatial anatomical domains at 5 pcw. We described detailed differentiation trajectories of the human forebrain and midbrain and found a large number of region-specific glioblasts that mature into distinct pre-astrocytes and pre–oligodendrocyte precursor cells.

Furthermore, using this catalogue of newly discovered lncRNAs we show that PAX5, a transcription factor required to specify the B cell lineage, bound to and regulated the expression of 109 lncRNAs in pro-B and mature B cells and 184 lncRNAs in acute lymphoblastic leukemia.},

  abstract = {Soon after the discovery of the Myc gene (c-Myc), it became clear that Myc expression levels tightly correlate to cell proliferation. The entry in cell cycle of quiescent cells upon Myc enforced expression has been described in many models. Also, the downregulation or inactivation of Myc results in the impairment of cell cycle progression. Given the frequent deregulation of Myc oncogene in human cancer it is important to dissect out the mechanisms underlying the role of Myc on cell cycle control. Several parallel mechanisms account for Myc-mediated stimulation of the cell cycle. First, most of the critical positive cell cycle regulators are encoded by genes induced by Myc. These Myc target genes include Cdks, cyclins and E2F transcription factors. Apart from its direct effects on the transcription, Myc is able to hyperactivate cyclin/Cdk complexes through the induction of Cdk activating kinase (CAK) and Cdc25 phosphatases. Moreover, Myc antagonizes the activity of cell cycle inhibitors as p21 and p27 through different mechanisms. Thus, Myc is able to block p21 transcription or to induce Skp2, a protein involved in p27 degradation. Finally, Myc induces DNA replication by binding to replication origins and by upregulating genes encoding proteins required for replication initiation. Myc also regulates genes involved in the mitotic control. A promising approach to treat tumors with deregulated Myc is the synthetic lethality based on the inhibition of Cdks. Thus, the knowledge of the Myc-dependent cell cycle regulatory mechanisms will help to discover new therapeutic approaches directed against malignancies with deregulated Myc.

Their lengths range from 27,317 nt for HCoV-229E to 31,357 nt for the murine hepatitis virus-A59, establishing the coronavirus genome as the largest known among RNA viruses. The basic organization of the coronavirus genome is shared with other members of the Nidovirus order (the torovirus genus, also in the family Coronaviridae, and members of the family Arteriviridae) in that the nonstructural proteins involved in proteolytic processing, genome replication, and subgenomic mRNA synthesis (transcription) (an estimated 14–16 end products for coronaviruses) are encoded within the 5′-proximal two-thirds of the genome on gene 1 and the (mostly) structural proteins are encoded within the 3′-proximal one-third of the genome (8–9 genes for coronaviruses). Genes for the major structural proteins in all coronaviruses occur in the 5′ to 3′ order as S, E, M, and N. The precise strategy used by coronaviruses for genome replication is not yet known, but many features have been established. This chapter focuses on some of the known features and presents some current questions regarding genome replication strategy, the cis-acting elements necessary for genome replication [as inferred from defective interfering (DI) RNA molecules], the minimum sequence requirements for autonomous replication of an RNA replicon, and the importance of gene order in genome replication.},

However, the precise mechanisms by which H3-K27M causes tumor initiation remain unclear. Here, we use human hindbrain neural stem cells to model the consequences of H3.3-K27M on the epigenomic landscape in a relevant developmental context. Genome-wide mapping of epitope-tagged histone H3.3 revealed that both the wild type and the K27M mutant incorporate abundantly at pre-existing active enhancers and promoters, and to a lesser extent at Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2)-bound regions. At active enhancers, H3.3-K27M leads to focal H3K27ac loss, decreased chromatin accessibility and reduced transcriptional expression of nearby neurodevelopmental genes. In addition, H3.3-K27M deposition at a subset of PRC2 target genes leads to increased PRC2 and PRC1 binding and augmented transcriptional repression that can be partially reversed by PRC2 inhibitors. Our work suggests that, rather than imposing de novo transcriptional circuits, H3.3-K27M drives tumorigenesis by locking initiating cells in their pre-existing, immature epigenomic state, via disruption of PRC2 and enhancer functions.},

  abstract = {Lujo virus (LUJV), a new member of the family Arenaviridae and the first hemorrhagic fever–associated arenavirus from the Old World discovered in three decades, was isolated in South Africa during an outbreak of human disease characterized by nosocomial transmission and an unprecedented high case fatality rate of 80\% (4/5 cases). Unbiased pyrosequencing of RNA extracts from serum and tissues of outbreak victims enabled identification and detailed phylogenetic characterization within 72 hours of sample receipt. Full genome analyses of LUJV showed it to be unique and branching off the ancestral node of the Old World arenaviruses. The virus G1 glycoprotein sequence was highly diverse and almost equidistant from that of other Old World and New World arenaviruses, consistent with a potential distinctive receptor tropism. LUJV is a novel, genetically distinct, highly pathogenic arenavirus., In September and October 2008, five cases of undiagnosed hemorrhagic fever, four of them fatal, were recognized in South Africa after air transfer of a critically ill index case from Zambia. Serum and tissue samples from victims were subjected to unbiased pyrosequencing, yielding within 72 hours of sample receipt, multiple discrete sequence fragments that represented approximately 50\% of a prototypic arenavirus genome. Thereafter, full genome sequence was generated by PCR amplification of intervening fragments using specific primers complementary to sequence obtained by pyrosequencing and a universal primer targeting the conserved arenaviral termini. Phylogenetic analyses confirmed the presence of a new member of the family Arenaviridae, provisionally named Lujo virus (LUJV) in recognition of its geographic origin (Lusaka, Zambia, and Johannesburg, South Africa). Our findings enable the development of specific reagents to further investigate the reservoir, geographic distribution, and unusual pathogenicity of LUJV, and confirm the utility of unbiased high throughput pyrosequencing for pathogen discovery and public health.},

  abstract = {Complete Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) genome sequences were obtained from nasal swabs of dromedary camels sampled in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia through direct analysis of nucleic acid extracts or following virus isolation in cell culture. Consensus dromedary MERS-CoV genome sequences were the same with either template source and identical to published human MERS-CoV sequences. However, in contrast to individual human cases, where only clonal genomic sequences are reported, detailed population analyses revealed the presence of more than one genomic variant in individual dromedaries. If humans are truly infected only with clonal virus populations, we must entertain a model for interspecies transmission of MERS-CoV wherein only specific genotypes are capable of passing bottleneck selection. IMPORTANCE In most cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), the route for human infection with the causative agent, MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV), is unknown. Antibodies to and viral nucleic acids of MERS-CoV have been found in dromedaries, suggesting the possibility that they may serve as a reservoir or vector for human infection. However, neither whole viral genomic sequence nor infectious virus has been isolated from dromedaries or other animals in Saudi Arabia. Here, we report recovery of MERS-CoV from nasal swabs of dromedaries, demonstrate that MERS-CoV whole-genome consensus sequences from dromedaries and humans are indistinguishable, and show that dromedaries can be simultaneously infected with more than one MERS-CoV. Together with data indicating widespread dromedary infection in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, these findings support the plausibility of a role for dromedaries in human infection.},

We demonstrate that ULI-NChIP-seq generates high-quality maps of covalent histone marks from 103 to 106 embryonic stem cells. Subsequently, we show that ULI-NChIP-seq H3K27me3 profiles generated from E13.5 primordial germ cells isolated from single male and female embryos show high similarity to recent data sets generated using 50–180 × more material. Finally, we identify sexually dimorphic H3K27me3 enrichment at specific genic promoters, thereby illustrating the utility of this method for generating high-quality and -complexity libraries from rare cell populations.},

This early IL-4 transcription is STAT6 independent and occurs before an increase in GATA-3. Furthermore, the strength of the TCR signal differentially affects the balance of NFATp and NFATc DNA binding activity, thereby regulating IL-4 transcription. Low-potency TCR signals result in high levels of nuclear NFATc and low levels of NFATp, which are permissive for IL-4 transcription.

Tiling clones are transfected into specific cell types to test for the presence of transcriptional regulatory regions. The protocol includes testing of different single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) alleles to determine their effect on regulatory activity. This procedure provides a systematic framework for identifying candidate functional SNPs within a locus during functional analysis of genome-wide association studies. This protocol adapts and combines previous well-established molecular biology methods to provide a streamlined strategy, based on automated primer design and recombinational cloning, allowing one to rapidly go from a genomic locus to a set of candidate functional SNPs in 8 weeks.},

  abstract = {HeLa was the first human cell line established (1952) and became one of the most frequently used lines because of its hardiness and rapid growth rate. During the next two decades, the development of other human cell lines mushroomed. One reason for this became apparent during the 1970s, when it was demonstrated that many of these cell lines had been overgrown and replaced by fast-growing HeLa cells inadvertently introduced into the original cultures. Although the discovery of these "HeLa contaminants" prompted immediate alarm, how aware are cell culturists today of the threat of cell line cross-contamination? To answer this question, we performed a literature search and conducted a survey of 483 mammalian cell culturists to determine how many were using HeLa contaminants without being aware of their true identity and how many were not using available means to ensure correct identity. Survey respondents included scientists, staff, and graduate students in 48 countries. HeLa cells were used by 32\% and HeLa contaminants by 9\% of survey respondents. Most were also using other cell lines; yet, only about a third of respondents were testing their lines for cell identity. Of all the cell lines used, 35\% had been obtained from another laboratory instead of from a repository, thus increasing the risk of false identity. Over 220 publications were found in the PubMed database (1969-2004) in which HeLa contaminants were used as a model for the tissue type of the original cell line. Overall, the results of this study indicate a lack of vigilance in cell acquisition and identity testing. Some researchers are still using HeLa contaminants without apparent awareness of their true identity. The consequences of cell line cross-contamination can be spurious scientific conclusions; its prevention can save time, resources, and scientific reputations.},

Although recent advances have improved our ability to document cellular phenotypic variation4,5,6,7,8, the fundamental mechanisms that generate variability from identical DNA sequences remain elusive. Here we reveal the landscape and principles of mammalian DNA regulatory variation by developing a robust method for mapping the accessible genome of individual cells by assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq)9 integrated into a programmable microfluidics platform. Single-cell ATAC-seq (scATAC-seq) maps from hundreds of single cells in aggregate closely resemble accessibility profiles from tens of millions of cells and provide insights into cell-to-cell variation. Accessibility variance is systematically associated with specific trans-factors and cis-elements, and we discover combinations of trans-factors associated with either induction or suppression of cell-to-cell variability. We further identify sets of trans-factors associated with cell-type-specific accessibility variance across eight cell types. Targeted perturbations of cell cycle or transcription factor signalling evoke stimulus-specific changes in this observed variability. The pattern of accessibility variation in cis across the genome recapitulates chromosome compartments10 de novo, linking single-cell accessibility variation to three-dimensional genome organization. Single-cell analysis of DNA accessibility provides new insight into cellular variation of the ‘regulome’.},

  abstract = {Programmed recognition of microbiota Increasingly, we recognize that the gut is a specialized organ for maintaining microbial symbioses alongside nutritional functions. The gut produces large quantities of immunoglobulin A (IgA), which adheres to the surface of gut microbes. Bunker et al. discovered that antibodies produced by naïve small intestinal plasma cells are recirculated and enriched within Peyer's patches, independently of exogenous antigen and T cell help. The resulting polyreactive IgAs are released into the gut lumen and bind to microbial surface glycans, thus innately recognizing the gut microbiota. Polyreactive IgAs appear to be a product of the coevolution of host and microbiota to maintain symbiotic homeostasis. Science, this issue p. eaan6619 Structured Abstract INTRODUCTIONImmunoglobulin A (IgA) is the most abundant mammalian antibody isotype, constituting more than 80\% of all antibody-secreting plasma cells at steady state. IgA is particularly prevalent at barrier surfaces such as the intestinal mucosa, where it forms a first line of defense in conjunction with innate mediators, including mucus and antimicrobial peptides. IgA is thought to coat and contain the resident commensal microbiota and provide protection against enteric pathogens. IgA responses occur under normal homeostatic conditions and involve both T cell–dependent and T cell–independent pathways of differentiation in mucosa-associated lymphoid tissues such as Peyer’s patches. However, despite its abundance, the specificity of homeostatic IgA has long remained elusive. RATIONALETo elucidate the specificity and origins of homeostatic IgA, we performed unbiased, large-scale cloning and characterization of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from single murine IgA plasma cells and other B cell populations of different origins. All antibodies were expressed recombinantly with an IgG1 isotype to compare their reactivity independent of their monomeric or multimeric nature. RESULTSPanels of single cell–derived mAbs were cloned from various B cell and IgA plasma cell populations, and their microbiota-reactivity was characterized by using a combination of bacterial flow cytometry and 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequencing. Additionally, mAbs were assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for polyreactivity—a peculiar property of certain antibodies that facilitates binding to a variety of structurally diverse antigens. Several insights emerged from this characterization: (i) Microbiota-reactive and polyreactive antibodies arose naturally in all naïve B cell populations but were significantly enriched among IgA-secreting plasma cells. (ii) Microbiota-reactive and polyreactive antibodies from naïve B cells and IgA plasma cells showed similar patterns of binding to a broad, but defined, subset of microbiota. This binding included many members of Proteobacteria but largely excluded those of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes, the predominant phyla in the colon. Interestingly, broadly neutralizing antibodies against influenza virus, which had previously been shown to be frequently polyreactive, were also commonly microbiota-reactive and displayed binding patterns that resembled IgAs. These patterns of microbiota-reactivity thus appear to be a general property of polyreactive antibodies. (iii) The microbiota-reactive and polyreactive IgA repertoire emerged via a mechanism that was largely independent of T cell help or somatic hypermutation. Instead, naturally microbiota-reactive and polyreactive recirculating naïve B cells were selected to become IgA plasma cells in Peyer’s patches. Although some antibodies subsequently acquired somatic mutations, these did not substantially alter their reactivity. (iv) Differentiation of microbiota-reactive and polyreactive IgAs occurred independent of microbiota or exogenous dietary antigen. Analysis of germ-free mice and germ-free mice fed an antigen-free diet demonstrated that microbiota-reactive and polyreactive IgA plasma cells arose naturally, even in the absence of exogenous antigens. CONCLUSIONWe conclude that homeostatic intestinal IgAs are natural polyreactive antibodies with innate specificity to microbiota. These data suggest that IgA antibodies, though derived from the adaptive immune system, possess innate-like recognition properties that may facilitate adaptation to the vast and dynamic array of exogenous microbiota and dietary antigens encountered at mucosal surfaces. {$<$}img class="fragment-image" src="https://d2ufo47lrtsv5s.cloudfront.net/content/sci/358/6361/eaan6619/F1.medium.gif"/{$>$} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Large-scale analysis of mAbs reveals the specificity and origins of homeostatic intestinal IgA.Panels of single cell–derived mAbs were cloned from murine IgA plasma cells and other B cell populations and characterized for microbiota-reactivity by bacterial flow cytometry and 16S rRNA sequencing or for polyreactivity against structurally diverse antigens, including DNA, insulin, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), flagellin, albumin, cardiolipin, and keyhole-limpet hemocyanin (KLH) by ELISA. This approach revealed that intestinal IgAs are natural polyreactive antibodies with innate specificity to microbiota. FSC, forward scatter. Large quantities of immunoglobulin A (IgA) are constitutively secreted by intestinal plasma cells to coat and contain the commensal microbiota, yet the specificity of these antibodies remains elusive. Here we profiled the reactivities of single murine IgA plasma cells by cloning and characterizing large numbers of monoclonal antibodies. IgAs were not specific to individual bacterial taxa but rather polyreactive, with broad reactivity to a diverse, but defined, subset of microbiota. These antibodies arose at low frequencies among naïve B cells and were selected into the IgA repertoire upon recirculation in Peyer’s patches. This selection process occurred independent of microbiota or dietary antigens. Furthermore, although some IgAs acquired somatic mutations, these did not substantially influence their reactivity. These findings reveal an endogenous mechanism driving homeostatic production of polyreactive IgAs with innate specificity to microbiota. Inherently polyreactive antibodies fuel homeostatic intestinal immuno­globulin A responses to the normal gut microbiota.

  abstract = {Summary During the humoral immune response, B cells undergo a dramatic change in phenotype to enable antibody affinity maturation in germinal centers (GCs). Using genome-wide chromosomal conformation capture (Hi-C), we found that GC B cells undergo massive reorganization of the genomic architecture that encodes the GC B cell transcriptome. Coordinate expression of genes that specify the GC B cell phenotype—most prominently BCL6—was achieved through a multilayered chromatin reorganization process involving (1) increased promoter connectivity, (2) formation of enhancer networks, (3) 5′ to 3′ gene looping, and (4) merging of gene neighborhoods that share active epigenetic marks. BCL6 was an anchor point for the formation of GC-specific gene and enhancer loops on chromosome 3. Deletion of a GC-specific, highly interactive locus control region upstream of Bcl6 abrogated GC formation in mice. Thus, large-scale and multi-tiered genomic three-dimensional reorganization is required for coordinate expression of phenotype-driving gene sets that determine the unique characteristics of GC B cells.},

  abstract = {Recent studies showed frequent mutations in histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27) demethylases in medulloblastomas of Group 3 and Group 4, suggesting a role for H3K27 methylation in these tumors. Indeed, trimethylated H3K27 (H3K27me3) levels were shown to be higher in Group 3 and 4 tumors compared to WNT and SHH medulloblastomas, also in tumors without detectable mutations in demethylases. Here, we report that polycomb genes, required for H3K27 methylation, are consistently upregulated in Group 3 and 4 tumors. These tumors show high expression of the homeobox transcription factor OTX2. Silencing of OTX2 in D425 medulloblastoma cells resulted in downregulation of polycomb genes such as EZH2, EED, SUZ12 and RBBP4 and upregulation of H3K27 demethylases KDM6A, KDM6B,JARID2 and KDM7A. This was accompanied by decreased H3K27me3 and increased H3K27me1 levels in promoter regions. Strikingly, the decrease of H3K27me3 was most prominent in promoters that bind OTX2. OTX2-bound promoters showed high levels of the H3K4me3 and H3K9ac activation marks and intermediate levels of the H3K27me3 inactivation mark, reminiscent of a bivalent modification. After silencing of OTX2, H3K27me3 levels strongly dropped, but H3K4me3 and H3K9ac levels remained high. OTX2-bound bivalent genes showed high expression levels in D425, but the expression of most of these genes did not change after OTX2 silencing and loss of the H3K27me3 mark. Maintaining promoters in a bivalent state by sustaining H3K27 trimethylation therefore seems to be an important function of OTX2 in medulloblastoma, while other transcription factors might regulate the actual expression levels of these genes.},

We are only beginning to understand the complex cross talk between neoplastic B cells and the tissue microenvironment, for example in secondary lymphoid organs, but some key cellular and molecular players have emerged. Mesenchymal stromal cells, nurselike cells (NLC) and lymphoma-associated macrophages (LAM), in concert with T cells, natural killer cells and extracellular matrix components participate in the dialog with the neoplastic B cells. B cell receptor signaling, activation via TNF family members (i.e. BAFF, APRIL), and tissue homing chemokine receptors and adhesion molecules are important in the interaction between malignant B cells and their microenvironment. Disrupting this cross talk is an attractive novel strategy for treating patients with B cell malignancies. Here, we summarize the cellular and molecular interactions between B cell lymphoma/leukemia cells and their microenvironment, and the therapeutic targets that are emerging, focusing on small molecule inhibitors that are targeting B cell receptor-associated kinases SYK, BTK, and PI3Ks, as well as on immunomodulatory agents and T cell mediated therapies.

Although initial treatment responses are often good, the vast majority of patients with SS fail to respond to ongoing therapy. We hypothesize that malignant T cells are highly heterogeneous and harbor subpopulations of SS cells that are both sensitive and resistant to treatment. Here, we investigate the presence of single-cell heterogeneity and resistance to histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) within primary malignant T cells from patients with SS. Using single-cell RNA sequencing and flow cytometry, we find that malignant T cells from all investigated patients with SS display a high degree of single-cell heterogeneity at both the mRNA and protein levels. We show that this heterogeneity divides the malignant cells into distinct subpopulations that can be isolated by their expression of different surface antigens. Finally, we show that treatment with HDACi (suberanilohydroxamic acid and romidepsin) selectively eliminates some subpopulations while leaving other subpopulations largely unaffected. In conclusion, we show that patients with SS display a high degree of single-cell heterogeneity within the malignant T-cell population, and that distinct subpopulations of malignant T cells carry HDACi resistance. Our data point to the importance of understanding the heterogeneous nature of malignant SS cells in each individual patient to design combinational and new therapies to counter drug resistance and treatment failure.},

Therefore, we conducted a pan-cancer analysis of lncRNAs comparing tumor and matched normal expression levels using RNA-Seq data from ∼ 3,000 patients in 8 solid tumor types. While the majority of differentially expressed lncRNAs display tissue-specific expression we discovered 229 lncRNAs with outlier or differential expression across multiple cancers, which we refer to as 'onco-lncRNAs'. Due to their consistent altered expression, we hypothesize that these onco-lncRNAs may have conserved oncogenic and tumor suppressive functions across cancers. To address this, we associated the onco-lncRNAs in biological processes based on their co-expressed protein coding genes. To validate our predictions, we experimentally confirmed cell growth dependence of 2 novel oncogenic lncRNAs, onco-lncRNA-3 and onco-lncRNA-12, and a previously identified lncRNA CCAT1. Overall, we discovered lncRNAs that may have broad oncogenic and tumor suppressor roles that could significantly advance our understanding of cancer lncRNA biology.},

  abstract = {Protection against deadly pathogens requires the production of high-affinity antibodies by B cells, which are generated in germinal centers (GCs). Alteration of the GC developmental program is common in many B cell malignancies. Identification of regulators of the GC response is crucial to develop targeted therapies for GC B cell dysfunctions, including lymphomas. The histone H3 lysine 27 methyltransferase enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) is highly expressed in GC B cells and is often constitutively activated in GC-derived non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHLs). The function of EZH2 in GC B cells remains largely unknown. Herein, we show that Ezh2 inactivation in mouse GC B cells caused profound impairment of GC responses, memory B cell formation, and humoral immunity. EZH2 protected GC B cells against activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) mutagenesis, facilitated cell cycle progression, and silenced plasma cell determinant and tumor suppressor B-lymphocyte-induced maturation protein 1 (BLIMP1). EZH2 inhibition in NHL cells induced BLIMP1, which impaired tumor growth. In conclusion, EZH2 sustains AID function and prevents terminal differentiation of GC B cells, which allows antibody diversification and affinity maturation. Dysregulation of the GC reaction by constitutively active EZH2 facilitates lymphomagenesis and identifies EZH2 as a possible therapeutic target in NHL and other GC-derived B cell diseases.},

However, more recent work—including studies on genetically altered mice and data from microarray analyses—has begun to identify the regulatory cascades that initiate and maintain the plasma cell phenotype. This review will summarize our current understanding of the molecules that regulate commitment to a plasma cell fate and those that mediate plasma cell function.},

  abstract = {A comprehensive mapping of interactions among Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) proteins and interactions of EBV proteins with human proteins should provide specific hypotheses and a broad perspective on EBV strategies for replication and persistence. Interactions of EBV proteins with each other and with human proteins were assessed by using a stringent high-throughput yeast two-hybrid system. Overall, 43 interactions between EBV proteins and 173 interactions between EBV and human proteins were identified. EBV-EBV and EBV-human protein interaction, or "interactome" maps provided a framework for hypotheses of protein function. For example, LF2, an EBV protein of unknown function interacted with the EBV immediate early R transactivator (Rta) and was found to inhibit Rta transactivation. From a broader perspective, EBV genes can be divided into two evolutionary classes, "core" genes, which are conserved across all herpesviruses and subfamily specific, or "noncore" genes. Our EBV-EBV interactome map is enriched for interactions among proteins in the same evolutionary class. Furthermore, human proteins targeted by EBV proteins were enriched for highly connected or "hub" proteins and for proteins with relatively short paths to all other proteins in the human interactome network. Targeting of hubs might be an efficient mechanism for EBV reorganization of cellular processes.},

  abstract = {The World Health Organization classification of lymphoid neoplasms updated in 2008 represents a worldwide consensus on the diagnosis of these tumors and is based on the recognition of distinct diseases, using a multidisciplinary approach. The updated classification refined the definitions of well-recognized diseases, identified new entities and variants, and incorporated emerging concepts in the understanding of lymphoid neoplasms. However, some questions were unresolved, such as the extent to which specific genetic or molecular alterations define certain tumors, and the status of provisional entities, categories for which the World Health Organization working groups felt there was insufficient evidence to recognize as distinct diseases at this time. In addition, since its publication, new findings and ideas have been generated. This review summarizes the scientific rationale for the classification, emphasizing changes that have had an effect on practice guidelines. The authors address the criteria and significance of early or precursor lesions and the identification of certain lymphoid neoplasms largely associated with particular age groups, such as children and the elderly. The issue of borderline categories having overlapping features with large B-cell lymphomas, as well as several provisional entities, is reviewed. These new observations chart a course for future research in the field.},

Polymorphisms in the genome that redistribute CTCF/cohesin occupancy rewire DNA cleavage sites to novel loop anchors. While transcription- and replication-coupled genomic rearrangements have been well documented, we demonstrate that DSBs formed at loop anchors are largely transcription-, replication-, and cell-type-independent. DSBs are continuously formed throughout interphase, are enriched on both sides of strong topological domain borders, and frequently occur at breakpoint clusters commonly translocated in cancer. Thus, loop anchors serve as fragile sites that generate DSBs and chromosomal rearrangements. Video Abstract},

Treatments for low- (extra-nodal marginal zone and follicular lymphomas) and high-grade (diffuse large B-cell lymphoma) are associated with local and vision-threatening toxicities. High-grade lymphomas relapse frequently and exhibit poor survival rates. Despite advances in genomic profiling and precision medicine, orbital and ocular adnexal lymphomas remain poorly characterized molecularly. We performed targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) profiling of 38 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded orbital and ocular adnexal lymphomas obtained from a single-center using a panel targeting near-term, clinically relevant genes. Potentially actionable mutations and copy number alterations were prioritized based on gain- and loss-of-function analyses, and catalogued, approved, and investigational therapies. Of 36 informative samples, including marginal zone lymphomas (n=20), follicular lymphomas (n=9), and diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (n=7), 53\% harbored a prioritized alteration (median=1, range 0–5/sample). MYD88 was the most frequently altered gene in our cohort, with potentially clinically relevant hotspot gain-of-function mutations identified in 71\% of diffuse large B-cell lymphomas and 25\% of marginal zone lymphomas. Prioritized alterations in epigenetic modulators were common and included gain-of-function EZH2 and loss-of-function ARID1A mutations (14\% of diffuse large B-cell lymphomas and 22\% of follicular lymphomas contained alterations in each of these two genes). Single prioritized alterations were also identified in the histone methyltransferases KMT2B (follicular lymphoma) and KMT3B (diffuse large B-cell lymphoma). Loss-of-function mutations and copy number alterations in the tumor suppressors TP53 (diffuse large B-cell and follicular lymphoma), CDKN2A (diffuse large B-cell and marginal zone lymphoma), PTEN (diffuse large B-cell lymphoma), ATM (diffuse large B-cell lymphoma), and NF1 (diffuse large B-cell lymphoma), and gain-of-function mutations in the oncogenes HRAS (follicular lymphoma) and NRAS (diffuse large B-cell lymphoma) were also observed. Together, our study demonstrates that NGS can be used to profile routine formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded orbital and ocular adnexal lymphomas for identification of somatic-driving alterations and nomination of potential therapeutic strategies.},

EED functions to recruit PRC1 to H3K27me3 loci and enhances PRC1-mediated H2A ubiquitin E3 ligase activity. Taken together, we suggest an integral role for EED as an epigenetic exchange factor coordinating the activities of PRC1 and 2.},

We found that Treg expansion occurred only with unfractionated splenocytes, suggesting that accessory cells and/or factors produced by them play an essential role in tumor-induced Treg expansion. We performed gene expression profiling on tumor-associated Treg cells to identify candidate signaling molecules and studied their effects on tumor-induced Treg expansion. We inadvertently discovered that interleukin (IL)-12 treatment blocked Treg expansion in an IL-12 receptor-dependent fashion. Additional studies showed that IL-12 acts by stimulating IFN-gamma mediated inhibition of Treg cell proliferation, which may partially account for the antitumor effects of IL-12. Furthermore, IL-12 treatment was found to decrease IL-2 production, which may lead to IFN-gamma-independent inhibition of Treg cells, as IL-2 is required for their survival and expansion. Mechanistic studies revealed that IFN-gamma signaling directly causes cell cycle arrest in Treg cells. This study shows that an IL-12-IFN-gamma axis can suppress tumor-induced Treg proliferation. This mechanism may counteract the ability of Treg cells to promote tumor growth in vivo.},

  abstract = {Recent studies have revealed the intrinsic histone methyltransferase (HMTase) activity of the EED-EZH2 complex and its role in Hox gene silencing, X inactivation, and cancer metastasis. In this study, we focus on the function of individual components. We found that the HMTase activity requires a minimum of three components—EZH2, EED, and SUZ12—while AEBP2 is required for optimal enzymatic activity. Using a stable SUZ12 knockdown cell line, we show SUZ12 knockdown results in cell growth defects, which correlate with genome-wide alteration on H3-K27 methylation as well as upregulation of a number of Hox genes. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay identified a 500 bp region located 4 kb upstream of the HoxA9 transcription initiation site as a SUZ12 binding site, which responds to SUZ12 knockdown and might play an important role in regulating HoxA9 expression. Thus, our study establishes a critical role of SUZ12 in H3-lysine 27 methylation and Hox gene silencing.},

  abstract = {Although CD4+ Th17 cells are enriched in normal intestines, their role in regulation of the host response to microbiota, and whether and how they contribute to intestinal homeostasis, is still largely unknown. It is also unclear whether Th17 cells regulate intestinal IgA production, which is also abundant in the intestinal lumen and has a crucial role as the first defense line in host response to microbiota. In this study, we found that intestinal polymeric Ig receptor (pIgR) and IgA production was impaired in T cell-deficient TCR-βxδ−/− mice. Repletion of TCR-βxδ−/− mice with Th17 cells from CBir1 flagellin TCR transgenic mice, which are specific for a commensal Ag, increased intestinal pIgR and IgA. The levels of intestinal pIgR and IgA in B6.IL-17R (IL-17R−/−) mice were lower than wild type mice. Treatment of colonic epithelial HT-29 cells with IL-17 increased pIgR expression. IL-17R−/− mice demonstrated systemic antimicroflora Ab response. Consistently, administering dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) to C57BL/6 mice after treatment with IL-17–neutralizing Ab resulted in more severe intestinal inflammation compared with control Ab. Administering DSS to IL-17R−/− mice resulted in increased weight loss and more severe intestinal inflammation compared with wild type mice, indicating a protective role of Th17 cells in intestinal inflammation. Individual mice with lower levels of pIgR and intestinal-secreted IgA correlated with increased weight loss at the end of DSS administration. Collectively, our data reveal that microbiota-specific Th17 cells contribute to intestinal homeostasis by regulating intestinal pIgR expression and IgA secretion.},

  abstract = {Continuous cell lines consist of cultured cells derived from a specific donor and tissue of origin that have acquired the ability to proliferate indefinitely. These cell lines are well-recognized models for the study of health and disease, particularly for cancer. However, there are cautions to be aware of when using continuous cell lines, including the possibility of contamination, in which a foreign cell line or microorganism is introduced without the handler's knowledge. Cross-contamination, in which the contaminant is another cell line, was first recognized in the 1950s but, disturbingly, remains a serious issue today. Many cell lines become cross-contaminated early, so that subsequent experimental work has been performed only on the contaminant, masquerading under a different name. What can be done in response—how can a researcher know if their own cell lines are cross-contaminated? Two practical responses are suggested here. First, it is important to check the literature, looking for previous work on cross-contamination. Some reports may be difficult to find and to make these more accessible, we have compiled a list of known cross-contaminated cell lines. The list currently contains 360 cell lines, drawn from 68 references. Most contaminants arise within the same species, with HeLa still the most frequently encountered (29\%, 106/360) among human cell lines, but interspecies contaminants account for a small but substantial minority of cases (9\%, 33/360). Second, even if there are no previous publications on cross-contamination for that cell line, it is essential to check the sample itself by performing authentication testing.},

  abstract = {Continuous human cell lines have been used extensively as models for biomedical research. In working with these cell lines, researchers are often unaware of the risk of cross-contamination and other causes of misidentification. To reduce this risk, there is a pressing need to authenticate cell lines, comparing the sample handled in the laboratory to a previously tested sample. The American Type Culture Collection Standards Development Organization Workgroup ASN-0002 has developed a Standard for human cell line authentication, recommending short tandem repeat (STR) profiling for authentication of human cell lines. However, there are known limitations to the technique when applied to cultured samples, including possible genetic drift with passage. In our study, a dataset of 2,279 STR profiles from four cell banks was used to assess the effectiveness of the match criteria recommended within the Standard. Of these 2,279 STR profiles, 1,157 were grouped into sets of related cell lines—duplicate holdings, legitimately related samples or misidentified cell lines. Eight core STR loci plus amelogenin were used to unequivocally authenticate 98\% of these related sets. Two simple match algorithms each clearly discriminated between related and unrelated samples, with separation between related samples at ≥80\% match and unrelated samples at {$<$}50\% match. A small degree of overlap was noted at 50–79\% match, mostly from cell lines known to display variable STR profiles. These match criteria are recommended as a simple and effective way to interpret results from STR profiling of human cell lines.},

  abstract = {The receptor TLR9, recognizing unmethylated bacterial DNA (CpG), is expressed by B cells and plays a role in the maintenance of serological memory. Little is known about the response of B cells stimulated with CpG alone, without additional cytokines. In this study, we show for the first time the phenotypic modification, changes in gene expression, and functional events downstream to TLR9 stimulation in human B cell subsets. In addition, we demonstrate that upon CpG stimulation, IgM memory B cells differentiate into plasma cells producing IgM Abs directed against the capsular polysaccharides of Streptococcus pneumoniae. This novel finding proves that IgM memory is the B cell compartment responsible for the defense against encapsulated bacteria. We also show that cord blood transitional B cells, corresponding to new bone marrow emigrants, respond to CpG. Upon TLR9 engagement, they de novo express AID and Blimp-1, genes necessary for hypersomatic mutation, class-switch recombination, and plasma cell differentiation and produce Abs with anti-pneumococcal specificity. Transitional B cells, isolated from cord blood, have not been exposed to pneumococcus in vivo. In addition, it is known that Ag binding through the BCR causes apoptotic cell death at this stage of development. Therefore, the ability of transitional B cells to sense bacterial DNA through TLR9 represents a tool to rapidly build up the repertoire of natural Abs necessary for our first-line defense at birth.},

Our data identified, further confirming previous studies, recurrent losses of 17p13.2-p11.2 and 10p12.1-q26.3 occurring in 71\% and 68\% of cases, respectively; common gains were detected for 17p11.2-q25.3 (64\%) and chromosome 8/8q (50\%). Moreover, we identified novel genomic lesions recurring in {$>$}30\% of tumors: loss of 9q13-q21.33 and gain of 10p15.3-10p12.2. Individual chromosomal aberrations did not show a significant correlation with prognosis; however, when more than three recurrent chromosomal alterations (gain or loss) were considered, a statistical association was observed using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Integrating mapping and transcriptional data, we were able to identify a total of 113 deregulated transcripts in aberrant chromosomal regions that included cancer-related genes such as members of the NF-κB pathway (BAG4, BTRC, NKIRAS2, PSMD3, and TRAF2) that might explain its constitutive activation in CTCL. Matching this list of genes with those discriminating patients with different survival times, we identify several common candidates that might exert critical roles in SS, such as BUB3 and PIP5K1B. Altogether, our study confirms and maps more precisely the regions of gain and loss and, combined to transcriptional profiles, suggests a novel set of genes of potential interest in SS.

  abstract = {Interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF4) is central to the transcriptional network of activated B-cell-like diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (ABC-DLBCL), an aggressive lymphoma subgroup defined by gene expression profiling. Since cofactor association modifies transcriptional regulatory input by IRF4, we assessed genome occupancy by IRF4 and endogenous cofactors in ABC-DLBCL cell lines. IRF4 partners with SPIB, PU.1 and BATF genome-wide, but SPIB provides the dominant IRF4 partner in this context. Upon SPIB knockdown IRF4 occupancy is depleted and neither PU.1 nor BATF acutely compensates. Integration with ENCODE data from lymphoblastoid cell line GM12878, demonstrates that IRF4 adopts either SPIB- or BATF-centric genome-wide distributions in related states of post-germinal centre B-cell transformation. In primary DLBCL high-SPIB and low-BATF or the reciprocal low-SPIB and high-BATF mRNA expression links to differential gene expression profiles across nine data sets, identifying distinct associations with SPIB occupancy, signatures of B-cell differentiation stage and potential pathogenetic mechanisms. In a population-based patient cohort, SPIBhigh/BATFlow-ABC-DLBCL is enriched for mutation of MYD88, and SPIBhigh/BATFlow-ABC-DLBCL with MYD88-L265P mutation identifies a small subgroup of patients among this otherwise aggressive disease subgroup with distinct favourable outcome. We conclude that differential expression of IRF4 cofactors SPIB and BATF identifies biologically and clinically significant heterogeneity among ABC-DLBCL.},

  abstract = {Summary Molecular mechanisms underlying terminal differentiation of B cells into plasma cells are major determinants of adaptive immunity but remain only partially understood. Here we present the transcriptional and epigenomic landscapes of cell subsets arising from activation of human naive B cells and differentiation into plasmablasts. Cell proliferation of activated B cells was linked to a slight decrease in DNA methylation levels, but followed by a committal step in which an S phase-synchronized differentiation switch was associated with an extensive DNA demethylation and local acquisition of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine at enhancers and genes related to plasma cell identity. Downregulation of both TGF-β1/SMAD3 signaling and p53 pathway supported this final step, allowing the emergence of a CD23-negative subpopulation in transition from B cells to~plasma cells. Remarkably, hydroxymethylation of PRDM1, a gene essential for plasma cell fate, was coupled to progression in S phase, revealing an intricate connection among cell cycle, DNA (hydroxy)methylation, and cell fate determination.},

  abstract = {Most of the mammalian genome is transcribed. This generates a vast repertoire of transcripts that includes protein-coding messenger RNAs, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and repetitive sequences, such as SINEs (short interspersed nuclear elements). A large percentage of ncRNAs are nuclear-enriched with unknown function. Antisense lncRNAs may form sense–antisense pairs by pairing with a protein-coding gene on the opposite strand to regulate epigenetic silencing, transcription and mRNA stability. Here we identify a nuclear-enriched lncRNA antisense to mouse ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase L1 (Uchl1), a gene involved in brain function and neurodegenerative diseases. Antisense Uchl1 increases UCHL1 protein synthesis at a post-transcriptional level, hereby identifying a new functional class of lncRNAs. Antisense Uchl1 activity depends on the presence of a 5′ overlapping sequence and an embedded inverted SINEB2 element. These features are shared by other natural antisense transcripts and can confer regulatory activity to an artificial antisense to green fluorescent protein. Antisense Uchl1 function is under the control of stress signalling pathways, as mTORC1 inhibition by rapamycin causes an increase in UCHL1 protein that is associated to the shuttling of antisense Uchl1 RNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Antisense Uchl1 RNA is then required for the association of the overlapping sense protein-coding mRNA to active polysomes for translation. These data reveal another layer of gene expression control at the post-transcriptional level.},

A mesenchymal phenotype is the hallmark of tumour aggressiveness in human malignant glioma, but the regulatory programs responsible for implementing the associated molecular signature are largely unknown. Here we show that reverse-engineering and an unbiased interrogation of a glioma-specific regulatory network reveal the transcriptional module that activates expression of mesenchymal genes in malignant glioma. Two transcription factors (C/EBPβ and STAT3) emerge as synergistic initiators and master regulators of mesenchymal transformation. Ectopic co-expression of C/EBPβ and STAT3 reprograms neural stem cells along the aberrant mesenchymal lineage, whereas elimination of the two factors in glioma cells leads to collapse of the mesenchymal signature and reduces tumour aggressiveness. In human glioma, expression of C/EBPβ and STAT3 correlates with mesenchymal differentiation and predicts poor clinical outcome. These results show that the activation of a small regulatory module is necessary and sufficient to initiate and maintain an aberrant phenotypic state in cancer cells.},

Histone H3S10 plays a key role in maintaining genome stability, as scored by ectopic recombination and plasmid loss, Rad52 foci, and Rad53 checkpoint activation. H3S10P coincides with the presence of DNA-RNA hybrids, is suppressed by ribonuclease~H overexpression, and causes reduced accessibility of restriction endonucleases, implying a tight connection between R loops, H3S10P, and chromatin compaction. Such histone modifications were also observed in R-loop-accumulating Caenorhabditis elegans and HeLa cells. We therefore provide a role of RNA in chromatin structure essential to understand how R loops modulate genome dynamics.},

The mechanisms by which proneural genes activate neurogenesis—and, in particular, the genes that they regulate—however, are mostly unknown. We performed a genome-wide characterization of the transcriptional targets of Ascl1 in the embryonic brain and in neural stem cell cultures by location analysis and expression profiling of embryos overexpressing or mutant for Ascl1. The wide range of molecular and cellular functions represented among these targets suggests that Ascl1 directly controls the specification of neural progenitors as well as the later steps of neuronal differentiation and neurite outgrowth. Surprisingly, Ascl1 also regulates the expression of a large number of genes involved in cell cycle progression, including canonical cell cycle regulators and oncogenic transcription factors. Mutational analysis in the embryonic brain and manipulation of Ascl1 activity in neural stem cell cultures revealed that Ascl1 is indeed required for normal proliferation of neural progenitors. This study identified a novel and unexpected activity of the proneural gene Ascl1, and revealed a direct molecular link between the phase of expansion of neural progenitors and the subsequent phases of cell cycle exit and neuronal differentiation.},

We established an assay to define the chromosomal location of DNA-associated proteins that are slated for degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. The genome-wide map described here ties proteolysis in mammalian cells to active enhancers and to promoters of specific gene families. Nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes in particular correlate with protein elimination, which positively affects their transcription. We show that the nuclear receptor corepressor NCoR1 is a key target of proteolysis and physically interacts with the transcription factor CREB. Proteasome inhibition stabilizes NCoR1 in a site-specific manner and restrains mitochondrial activity by repressing CREB-sensitive genes. In conclusion, this functional map of nuclear proteolysis links chromatin architecture with local protein stability and identifies proteolytic derepression as highly dynamic in regulating the transcription of genes involved in energy metabolism.},

  abstract = {Diffuse large B cell lymphomas (DLBCL) derive from germinal center (GC) B cells and display chromosomal alterations deregulating the expression of BCL6, a transcriptional repressor required for GC formation. To investigate the role of BCL6 in DLBCL pathogenesis, we have engineered mice that express BCL6 constitutively in B cells by mimicking a chromosomal translocation found in human DLBCL. These mice display increased GC formation and perturbed post-GC differentiation characterized by a decreased number of post-isotype switch plasma cells. Subsequently, these mice develop a lymphoproliferative syndrome that culminates with the development of lymphomas displaying features typical of human DLBCL. These results define the oncogenic role of BCL6 in the pathogenesis of DLBCL and provide a faithful mouse model of this common disease.},

  abstract = {Vitiligo is a classic autoimmune disease genetically associated with SNPs in the MHC class II region. To date, the impact of HLA molecules on autoimmunity has focused on structural diversity of antigen presentation. Here, we describe the properties of a 47-nucleotide high-risk haplotype of three SNPs within an intergenic “super-enhancer” located between the HLA-DRB1 and HLA-DQA1 genes, localized by a genome-wide association study of 2,853 subjects with vitiligo. Monocytes from healthy subjects homozygous for the high-risk haplotype have increased surface expression of HLA-DR and -DQ, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells from high-risk subjects produce more IL-1β and IFN-γ upon engagement of dectin-1, mannose, and Toll-like receptors. This study underscores the importance of transcriptional regulation of HLA genes to the risk of developing an autoimmune disease., Genetic risk for autoimmunity in HLA genes is most often attributed to structural specificity resulting in presentation of self-antigens. Autoimmune vitiligo is strongly associated with the MHC class II region. Here, we fine-map vitiligo MHC class II genetic risk to three SNPs only 47 bp apart, located within a predicted super-enhancer in an intergenic region between HLA-DRB1 and HLA-DQA1, localized by a genome-wide association study of 2,853 Caucasian vitiligo patients. The super-enhancer corresponds to an expression quantitative trait locus for expression of HLA-DR and HLA-DQ RNA; we observed elevated surface expression of HLA-DR (P = 0.008) and HLA-DQ (P = 0.02) on monocytes from healthy subjects homozygous for the high-risk SNP haplotype. Unexpectedly, pathogen-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells from subjects homozygous for the high-risk super-enhancer haplotype exhibited greater increase in production of IFN-γ and IL-1β than cells from subjects homozygous for the low-risk haplotype. Specifically, production of IFN-γ on stimulation of dectin-1, mannose, and Toll-like receptors with Candida albicans and Staphylococcus epidermidis was 2.5- and 2.9-fold higher in high-risk subjects than in low-risk subjects, respectively (P = 0.007 and P = 0.01). Similarly, production of IL-1β was fivefold higher in high-risk subjects than in low-risk subjects (P = 0.02). Increased production of immunostimulatory cytokines in subjects carrying the high-risk haplotype may act as an “adjuvant” during the presentation of autoantigens, tying together genetic variation in the MHC with the development of autoimmunity. This study demonstrates that for risk of autoimmune vitiligo, expression level of HLA class II molecules is as or more important than antigen specificity.},

One such compound disrupted BCL6/corepressor complexes in~vitro and in~vivo, and was observed by X-ray crystallography and NMR to bind the critical site within the BTB groove. This compound could induce expression of BCL6 target genes and kill BCL6-positive DLBCL cell lines. In xenotransplantation experiments, the compound was nontoxic and potently suppressed DLBCL tumors in~vivo. The compound also killed primary DLBCLs from human patients.},

The purpose of this study was to characterize the whole genome DNA methylation profile in children with precursor B-cell ALL (BCP ALL) and to compare this profile with methylation observed in normal bone marrow samples. Additional efforts were made to correlate the observed methylation patterns with selected clinical features. We assessed DNA methylation from bone marrow samples obtained from 38 children with BCP ALL at the time of diagnosis along with 4 samples of normal bone marrow cells as controls using Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip Array. Patients were diagnosed and stratified into prognosis groups according to the BFM ALL IC 2009 protocol. The analysis of differentially methylated sites across the genome as well as promoter methylation profiles allowed clear separation of the leukemic and control samples into two clusters. 86.6\% of the promoter-associated differentially methylated sites were hypermethylated in BCP ALL. Seven sites were found to correlate with the BFM ALL IC 2009 high risk group. Amongst these, one was located within the gene body of the MBP gene and another was within the promoter region- PSMF1 gene. Differentially methylated sites that were significantly related with subsets of patients with ETV6-RUNX1 fusion and hyperdiploidy. The analyzed translocations and change of genes’ sequence context does not affect methylation and methylation seems not to be a mechanism for the regulation of expression of the resulting fusion genes.},

We describe the challenges of generating a complete de novo genome assembly using current technologies and the impact that being able to perfectly sequence the genome would have on understanding human disease and evolution.

Combination of romidepsin with an MEK inhibitor may lead to greater responses in cancers in which the MAPK pathway is active.                                 , To identify molecular determinants of histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDI) resistance, we selected HuT78 cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) cells with romidepsin in the presence of P-glycoprotein inhibitors to prevent transporter upregulation. Resistant sublines were 250- to 385-fold resistant to romidepsin and were resistant to apoptosis induced by apicidin, entinostat, panobinostat, belinostat, and vorinostat. A custom TaqMan array identified increased insulin receptor (INSR) gene expression; immunoblot analysis confirmed increased protein expression and a four- to eightfold increase in mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase (MEK) phosphorylation in resistant cells compared with parental cells. Resistant cells were exquisitely sensitive to MEK inhibitors, and apoptosis correlated with restoration of proapoptotic Bim. Romidepsin combined with MEK inhibitors yielded greater apoptosis in cells expressing mutant KRAS compared with romidepsin treatment alone. Gene expression analysis of samples obtained from patients with CTCL enrolled on the NCI1312 phase 2 study of romidepsin in T-cell lymphoma suggested perturbation of the MAPK pathway by romidepsin. Immunohistochemical analysis of Bim expression demonstrated decreased expression in some skin biopsies at disease progression. These findings implicate increased activation of MEK and decreased Bim expression as a resistance mechanism to HDIs, supporting combination of romidepsin with MEK inhibitors in clinical trials.},

To address this, here we performed multiomics single-cell profiling—integrating DNA methylation, transcriptome and genotype within the same cells—of diffuse gliomas, tumors characterized by defined transcriptional cell state diversity. Direct comparison of the epigenetic profiles of distinct cell states revealed key switches for state transitions recapitulating neurodevelopmental trajectories and highlighted dysregulated epigenetic mechanisms underlying gliomagenesis. We further developed a quantitative framework to directly measure cell state heritability and transition dynamics based on high-resolution lineage trees in human samples. We demonstrated heritability of malignant cell states, with key differences in hierarchal and plastic cell state architectures in IDH-mutant glioma versus IDH-wild-type glioblastoma, respectively. This work provides a framework anchoring transcriptional cancer cell states in their epigenetic encoding, inheritance and transition dynamics.},

The current classification does not fully explain the biological and clinical heterogeneity of DLBCLs. In this study we carried out genome-wide DNA methylation profiling of 140 DLBCL samples and 10 normal germinal center B-cells (NGCBs) using the HELP assay and hybridization to a custom Roche NimbleGen promoter array. We defined methylation disruption as a main epigenetic event in DLBCLs and designed a method for measuring the methylation variability of individual cases. We then used a novel approach for unsupervised hierarchical clustering based on the extent of DNA methylation variability. This approach identified 6 clusters (A-F). The extent of methylation variability was associated with survival outcomes, with significant differences in overall and progression-free survival. The novel clusters are characterized by disruption of specific biological pathways like cytokine-mediated signaling, ephrin signaling and pathways associated with apoptosis and cell cycle regulation. In a subset of patients, we profiled gene expression and genomic variation to investigate their interplay with methylation changes. This study is the first to identify novel epigenetic clusters of DLBCLs and their aberrantly methylated genes, molecular associations and survival.},

  abstract = {Injury and loss of oligodendrocytes can cause demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis. To improve our understanding of human oligodendrocyte development, which could facilitate development of remyelination-based treatment strategies, here we describe time-course single-cell-transcriptomic analysis of developing human stem cell-derived oligodendrocyte-lineage-cells (hOLLCs). The study includes hOLLCs derived from both genome engineered embryonic stem cell (ESC) reporter cells containing an Identification-and-Purification tag driven by the endogenous PDGFRα promoter and from unmodified induced pluripotent (iPS) cells. Our analysis uncovers substantial transcriptional heterogeneity of PDGFRα-lineage hOLLCs. We discover sub-populations of human oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (hOPCs) including a potential cytokine-responsive hOPC subset, and identify candidate regulatory genes/networks that define the identity of these sub-populations. Pseudotime trajectory analysis defines developmental pathways of oligodendrocytes vs astrocytes from PDGFRα-expressing hOPCs and predicts differentially expressed genes between the two lineages. In addition, pathway enrichment analysis followed by pharmacological intervention of these pathways confirm that mTOR and cholesterol biosynthesis signaling pathways are involved in maturation of oligodendrocytes from hOPCs.},

  abstract = {The hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α (HNF-4α; also known as NR2A1) is a member of the nuclear receptor (NR) family of transcription factors, which have conserved DNA-binding domains and ligand-binding domains. HNF-4α is the most abundant DNA-binding protein in the liver, where some 40\% of the actively transcribed genes have a HNF-4α response element. These regulated genes are largely involved in the hepatic gluconeogenic program and lipid metabolism. In the pancreas HNF-4α is also a master regulator, controlling an estimated 11\% of islet genes. HNF-4α protein mutations are linked to maturity-onset diabetes of the young, type 1 (MODY1) and hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia. Previous structural analyses of NRs, although productive in elucidating the structure of individual domains, have lagged behind in revealing the connectivity patterns of NR domains. Here we describe the 2.9 Å crystal structure of the multidomain human HNF-4α homodimer bound to its DNA response element and coactivator-derived peptides. A convergence zone connects multiple receptor domains in an asymmetric fashion, joining distinct elements from each monomer. An arginine target of PRMT1 methylation protrudes directly into this convergence zone and sustains its integrity. A serine target of protein kinase C is also responsible for maintaining domain–domain interactions. These post-translational modifications lead to changes in DNA binding by communicating through the tightly connected surfaces of the quaternary fold. We find that some MODY1 mutations, positioned on the ligand-binding domain and hinge regions of the receptor, compromise DNA binding at a distance by communicating through the interjunctional surfaces of the complex. The overall domain representation of the HNF-4α homodimer is different from that of the PPAR-γ–RXR-α heterodimer, even when both NR complexes are assembled on the same DNA element. Our findings suggest that unique quaternary folds and interdomain connections in NRs could be exploited by small-molecule allosteric modulators that affect distal functions in these polypeptides.},

  abstract = {Increased expression of the immunosuppressive cytokines, TGF-β1 and IL-10, is a hallmark of the advanced stages of cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL), where it has been associated with suppressed immunity, increased susceptibility to infections, and diminished antitumor responses. Yet, little is known about the transcriptional regulation of TGF-β1 and IL-10 in CTCL, and about their function in regulating the CTCL cell responses. In this article, we show that TGF-β1 and IL-10 expression in CTCL cells is regulated by NF-κB and suppressed by bortezomib (BZ), which has shown promising results in the treatment of CTCL. However, although the TGF-β1 expression is IκBα dependent and is regulated by the canonical pathway, the IL-10 expression is IκBα independent, and its inhibition by BZ is associated with increased promoter recruitment of p52 that characterizes the noncanonical pathway. TGF-β1 suppression decreases CTCL cell viability and increases apoptosis, and adding exogenous TGF-β1 increases viability of BZ-treated CTCL cells, indicating TGF-β1 prosurvival function in CTCL cells. In addition, TGF-β1 suppression increases expression of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-8 and IL-17 in CTCL cells, suggesting that TGF-β1 also regulates the IL-8 and IL-17 expression. Importantly, our results demonstrate that BZ inhibits expression of the chemokine receptor CXCR4 in CTCL cells, resulting in their decreased migration, and that the CTCL cell migration is mediated by TGF-β1. These findings provide the first insights into the BZ-regulated TGF-β1 and IL-10 expression in CTCL cells, and indicate that TGF-β1 has a key role in regulating CTCL survival, inflammatory gene expression, and migration.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) comprises a group of diseases characterized by the abnormal development of malignant myeloid cells. Recent studies have demonstrated an important role for aberrant transcriptional regulation in AML pathophysiology. Although several transcription factors (TFs) involved in myeloid development and leukemia have been studied extensively and independently, how these TFs coordinate with others and how their dysregulation perturbs the genetic circuitry underlying myeloid differentiation is not yet known. We propose an integrated approach for mammalian genetic network construction by combining the analysis of gene expression profiling data and the identification of TF binding sites. RESULTS: We utilized our approach to construct the genetic circuitries operating in normal myeloid differentiation versus acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), a subtype of AML. In the normal and disease networks, we found that multiple transcriptional regulatory cascades converge on the TFs Rora and Rxra, respectively. Furthermore, the TFs dysregulated in APL participate in a common regulatory pathway and may perturb the normal network through Fos. Finally, a model of APL pathogenesis is proposed in which the chimeric TF PML-RARalpha activates the dysregulation in APL through six mediator TFs. CONCLUSION: This report demonstrates the utility of our approach to construct mammalian genetic networks, and to obtain new insights regarding regulatory circuitries operating in complex diseases in humans.},

However, the applicability and efficiency of this system in model organisms, such as zebrafish, are little studied. Here, we report that RNA-guided Cas9 nuclease efficiently facilitates genome editing in both mammalian cells and zebrafish embryos in a simple and robust manner. Over 35\% of site-specific somatic mutations were found when specific Cas/gRNA was used to target either etsrp, gata4 or gata5 in zebrafish embryos in vivo. The Cas9/gRNA efficiently induced biallelic conversion of etsrp or gata5 in the resulting somatic cells, recapitulating their respective vessel phenotypes in etsrpy11 mutant embryos or cardia bifida phenotypes in fautm236a mutant embryos. Finally, we successfully achieved site-specific insertion of mloxP sequence induced by Cas9/gRNA system in zebrafish embryos. These results demonstrate that the Cas9/gRNA system has the potential of becoming a simple, robust and efficient reverse genetic tool for zebrafish and other model organisms. Together with other genome-engineering technologies, the Cas9 system is promising for applications in biology, agriculture, environmental studies and medicine.},

This SC injury response is dependent on an intricate gene regulatory program coordinated by a number of transcription factors and microRNAs, but the interactions among them remain largely unknown. Uncovering the transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulatory networks governing the Schwann cell injury response is a key step towards a better understanding of Schwann cell biology and may help develop novel therapies for related diseases. Performing such comprehensive network analysis requires systematic bioinformatics methods to integrate multiple genomic datasets. RESULTS: In this study we present a computational pipeline to infer transcription factor and microRNA regulatory networks. Our approach combined mRNA and microRNA expression profiling data, ChIP-Seq data of transcription factors, and computational transcription factor and microRNA target prediction. Using mRNA and microRNA expression data collected in a Schwann cell injury model, we constructed a regulatory network and studied regulatory pathways involved in Schwann cell response to injury. Furthermore, we analyzed network motifs and obtained insights on cooperative regulation of transcription factors and microRNAs in Schwann cell injury recovery. CONCLUSIONS: This work demonstrates a systematic method for gene regulatory network inference that may be used to gain new information on gene regulation by transcription factors and microRNAs.},

  abstract = {Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is a heterogeneous disease defined by transcriptional classifications, specific signaling and survival pathways, and multiple low-frequency genetic alterations. Preclinical model systems that capture the genetic and functional heterogeneity of DLBCL are urgently needed. Here, we generated and characterized a panel of large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL) patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models, including 8 that reflect the immunophenotypic, transcriptional, genetic, and functional heterogeneity of primary DLBCL and 1 that is a plasmablastic lymphoma. All LBCL PDX models were subjected to whole-transcriptome sequencing to classify cell of origin and consensus clustering classification (CCC) subtypes. Mutations and chromosomal rearrangements were evaluated by whole-exome sequencing with an extended bait set. Six of the 8 DLBCL models were activated B-cell (ABC)-type tumors that exhibited ABC-associated mutations such as MYD88, CD79B, CARD11, and PIM1. The remaining 2 DLBCL models were germinal B-cell type, with characteristic alterations of GNA13, CREBBP, and EZH2, and chromosomal translocations involving IgH and either BCL2 or MYC. Only 25\% of the DLBCL PDX models harbored inactivating TP53 mutations, whereas 75\% exhibited copy number alterations of TP53 or its upstream modifier, CDKN2A, consistent with the reported incidence and type of p53 pathway alterations in primary DLBCL. By CCC criteria, 6 of 8 DLBCL PDX models were B-cell receptor (BCR)-type tumors that exhibited selective surface immunoglobulin expression and sensitivity to entospletinib, a recently developed spleen tyrosine kinase inhibitor. In summary, we have established and characterized faithful PDX models of DLBCL and demonstrated their usefulness in functional analyses of proximal BCR pathway inhibition.},

  abstract = {Control of gene expression is exerted at a number of different levels, one of which is the accessibility of genes and their controlling elements to the transcriptional machinery. Accessibility is dictated broadly by the degree of chromatin compaction, which is influenced in part by polycomb group proteins. EZH2, together with SUZ12 and EED, forms the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), which catalyzes trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3). PRC2 may recruit other polycomb complexes, DNA methyltransferases, and histone deacetylases, resulting in additional transcriptional repressive marks and chromatin compaction at key developmental loci. Overexpression of EZH2 is a marker of advanced and metastatic disease in many solid tumors, including prostate and breast cancer. Mutation of EZH2 Y641 is described in lymphoma and results in enhanced activity, whereas inactivating mutations are seen in poor prognosis myeloid neoplasms. No histone demethylating agents are currently available for treatment of patients, but 3-deazaneplanocin (DZNep) reduces EZH2 levels and H3K27 trimethylation, resulting in reduced cell proliferation in breast and prostate cancer cells in vitro. Furthermore, synergistic effects are seen for combined treatment with DNA demethylating agents and histone deacetylation inhibitors, opening up the possibility of refined epigenetic treatments in the future.

  abstract = {Similar to most cancers, genome-wide DNA methylation profiles are commonly altered in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL); however, recent observations highlight that a large portion of malignancy-associated DNA methylation alterations are not accompanied by related gene expression changes. By analyzing and integrating the methylome and transcriptome profiles of pediatric B-cell ALL cases and primary tissue controls, we report 325 genes hypermethylated and downregulated and 45 genes hypomethylated and upregulated in pediatric B-cell ALL, irrespective of subtype. Repressed cation channel subunits and cAMP signaling activators and transducers are overrepresented, potentially indicating a reduced cellular potential to receive and propagate apoptotic signals. Furthermore, we report specific DNA methylation alterations with concurrent gene expression changes within individual ALL subtypes. The ETV6-RUNX1 translocation was associated with downregulation of ASNS and upregulation of the EPO-receptor, while Hyperdiploid patients ({$>$} 50 chr) displayed upregulation of B-cell lymphoma (BCL) members and repression of PTPRG and FHIT. In combination, these data indicate genetically distinct B-cell ALL subtypes contain cooperative epimutations and genome-wide epigenetic deregulation is common across all B-cell ALL subtypes.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: AHNAK, also known as desmoyokin, is a giant protein with the molecular size of approximately 700 kDa and exerts diverse functions in different types of cancer. RESULTS: In the present study, we demonstrated that AHNAK mRNA levels were down-regulated in 7 out of 8 human breast cancer cell lines, especially in triple - negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell lines. Moreover, in patients with TNBC, the expression of AHNAK gene was inversely correlated with the tumor status (P\,=\,0.015), lymph node status (P\,{$<$}\,0.001), lymph node (LN) infiltration (P\,{$<$}\,0.001) and TNM stage (P\,{$<$}\,0.001). Moreover, down-regulated AHNAK expression was considered an independent prognostic factor associated with the poor survival of patients with TNBC. Overexpression of AHNAK in two TNBC cell lines, MDA-MB-231 and BT549, suppressed the in vitro TNBC cell proliferation and colony formation, and inhibited the in vivo TNBC xenograft growth and lung metastasis. The tumor suppressing effect of AHNAK in TNBC was associated with the AKT/MAPK signaling pathway and Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Consistent results were observed when AHNAK was knockdown in BT20 and MDA-MB-435 cells. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our results suggest that AHNAK acts as a tumor suppressor that negatively regulates TNBC cell proliferation, TNBC xenograft growth and metastasis via different signaling pathways.},

Through integrative analysis of 1,134 genome-wide epigenetic profiles, mutations from {$>$}8,200 tumor-normal pairs and our experimental data from clinical samples, we discovered broad peaks for trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4me3; wider than 4 kb) as the first epigenetic signature for tumor suppressors in normal cells. Broad H3K4me3 is associated with increased transcription elongation and enhancer activity, which together lead to exceptionally high gene expression, and is distinct from other broad epigenetic features, such as super-enhancers. Genes with broad H3K4me3 peaks conserved across normal cells may represent pan-cancer tumor suppressors, such as TP53 and PTEN, whereas genes with cell type–specific broad H3K4me3 peaks may represent cell identity genes and cell type–specific tumor suppressors. Furthermore, widespread shortening of broad H3K4me3 peaks in cancers is associated with repression of tumor suppressors. Thus, the broad H3K4me3 epigenetic signature provides mutation-independent information for the discovery and characterization of new tumor suppressors.},

  abstract = {Pan-histone deacetylase inhibitors, for example, vorinostat and panobinostat (LBH589; Novartis Pharmaceuticals, East Hanover, NJ), have shown clinical efficacy against advanced cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL). However, the molecular basis of this activity remains unclear. HDAC7, a class IIA histone deacetylase (HDAC), is overexpressed in thymocytes, where it represses expression of the proapoptotic nuclear orphan receptor Nur77. Here, we demonstrate that treatment with panobinostat rapidly inhibits the in vitro and intracellular activity, as well as the mRNA and protein levels of HDAC7, and induces expression and translocation of Nur77 to the mitochondria. There, Nur77 converts death resistance protein Bcl-2 into a killer protein, promoting cell death of cultured and patient-derived human CTCL cells. Treatment with panobinostat improved survival of athymic nude mice implanted with human CTCL cells. Ectopic expression of Nur77 induced apoptosis and sensitized HH cells to panobinostat, whereas combined knockdown of Nur77 and its family member Nor1 was necessary to inhibit panobinostat-induced apoptosis of CTCL cells. Cotreatment with the Bcl-2/Bcl-xL antagonist ABT-737 decreased resistance and synergistically induced apoptosis of human CTCL cells. These findings mechanistically implicate HDAC7 and Nur77 in sensitizing human CTCL cells to panobinostat as well as suggest that cotreatment with an anti–Bcl-2 agent would augment the anti-CTCL activity of panobinostat.},

In several tumour types, diverse oncogenic, transcriptional and metabolic abnormalities cooperate to generate hostile microenvironments that disrupt ER homeostasis in malignant and stromal cells, as well as infiltrating leukocytes. These changes provoke a state of persistent ER stress that has been demonstrated to govern multiple pro-tumoural attributes in the cancer cell while dynamically reprogramming the function of innate and adaptive immune cells. Aberrant activation of ER stress sensors and their downstream signalling pathways have therefore emerged as key regulators of tumour growth and metastasis as well as response to chemotherapy, targeted therapies and immunotherapy. In this Review, we discuss the physiological inducers of ER stress in the tumour milieu, the interplay between oncogenic signalling and ER stress response pathways in the cancer cell and the profound immunomodulatory effects of sustained ER stress responses in tumours.},

  abstract = {Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a recently recognized, immune-mediated disease characterized clinically by symptoms of esophageal dysfunction and histologically by eosinophil-predominant inflammation. The chronic esophageal eosinophilia of EoE is associated with tissue remodeling that includes epithelial hyperplasia, subepithelial fibrosis, and hypertrophy of esophageal smooth muscle. This remodeling causes the esophageal rings and strictures that frequently complicate EoE and underlies the mucosal fragility that predisposes to painful mucosal tears in the EoE esophagus. The pathogenesis of tissue remodeling in EoE is not completely understood, but emerging studies suggest that secretory products of eosinophils and mast cells, as well as cytokines produced by other inflammatory cells, epithelial cells, and stromal cells in the esophagus, all contribute to the process. Interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13, Th2 cytokines overproduced in allergic disorders, have direct profibrotic and remodeling effects in EoE. The EoE esophagus exhibits increased expression of transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1, which is a potent activator of fibroblasts and a strong inducer of epithelial-mesenchymal transition. In addition, IL-4, IL-13, and TGF-β all have a role in regulating periostin, an extracellular matrix protein that might influence remodeling by acting as a ligand for integrins, by its effects on eosinophils or by activating fibrogenic genes in the esophagus. Presently, few treatments have been shown to affect the tissue remodeling that causes EoE complications. This report reviews the potential roles of fibroblasts, eosinophils, mast cells, and profibrotic cytokines in esophageal remodeling in EoE and identifies potential targets for future therapies that might prevent EoE complications.},

  abstract = {Histone H3.3 glycine 34 to arginine/valine (G34R/V) mutations drive deadly gliomas and show exquisite regional and temporal specificity, suggesting a developmental context permissive to their effects. Here we show that 50\% of G34R/V tumors (n~= 95) bear activating PDGFRA mutations that display strong selection pressure at recurrence. Although considered gliomas, G34R/V tumors actually arise in GSX2/DLX-expressing interneuron progenitors, where G34R/V mutations impair neuronal differentiation. The lineage of origin may facilitate PDGFRA co-option through a chromatin loop connecting PDGFRA to GSX2 regulatory elements, promoting PDGFRA overexpression and mutation. At the single-cell level, G34R/V tumors harbor dual neuronal/astroglial identity and lack oligodendroglial programs, actively repressed by GSX2/DLX-mediated cell fate specification. G34R/V may become dispensable for tumor maintenance, whereas mutant-PDGFRA is potently oncogenic. Collectively, our results open novel research avenues in deadly tumors. G34R/V gliomas are neuronal malignancies where interneuron progenitors are stalled in differentiation by G34R/V mutations and malignant gliogenesis is promoted by co-option of a potentially targetable pathway, PDGFRA signaling.},

  abstract = {Numerous chromatin-remodeling factors are regulated by interactions with RNA, although the contexts and functions of RNA binding are poorly understood. Here we show that R loops, RNA-DNA hybrids consisting of nascent transcripts hybridized to template DNA, modulate the binding of two key chromatin-regulatory complexes, Tip60–p400 and polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Like PRC2, the Tip60–p400 histone acetyltransferase complex binds to nascent transcripts; however, transcription promotes chromatin binding of Tip60–p400 but not PRC2. Interestingly, we observed higher Tip60–p400 and lower PRC2 levels at genes marked by promoter-proximal R loops. Furthermore, disruption of R loops broadly decreased Tip60–p400 occupancy and increased PRC2 occupancy genome wide. In agreement with these alterations, ESCs partially depleted of R loops exhibited impaired differentiation. These results show that R loops act both positively and negatively in modulating the recruitment of key pluripotency regulators.},

To define the landscape of somatic mutations in pediatric osteosarcoma, we performed whole-genome sequencing of DNA from 20 osteosarcoma tumor samples and matched normal tissue in a discovery cohort, as well as 14 samples in a validation cohort. Single-nucleotide variations (SNVs) exhibited a pattern of localized hypermutation called kataegis in 50\% of the tumors. We identified p53 pathway lesions in all tumors in the discovery cohort, nine of which were translocations in the first intron of the TP53 gene. Beyond TP53, the RB1, ATRX, and DLG2 genes showed recurrent somatic alterations in 29\%–53\% of the tumors. These data highlight the power of whole-genome sequencing for identifying recurrent somatic alterations in cancer genomes that may be missed using other methods.},

We performed single-cell RNA sequencing on the mouse embryonic medial ganglionic eminence (MGE), the major birthplace for CINs, and on MGE-like cells differentiated from embryonic stem cells. Two distinct cell types were identified as proliferating neural progenitors and immature neurons, both of which comprised sub-populations. Although lineage development of MGE progenitors was reconstructed and immature neurons were characterized as GABAergic, cells that might correspond to precursors of different CINs were not identified. A few non-neuronal cell types were detected, including microglia. In vitro MGE-like cells resembled bona fide MGE cells but expressed lower levels of Foxg1 and Epha4. Together, our data provide detailed understanding of the embryonic MGE developmental program and suggest how CINs are specified.},

  abstract = {Summary Whereas chromosomal translocations are common pathogenetic events in cancer, mechanisms that promote them are poorly understood. To elucidate translocation mechanisms in mammalian cells, we developed high-throughput, genome-wide translocation sequencing (HTGTS). We employed HTGTS to identify tens of thousands of independent translocation junctions involving fixed I-SceI meganuclease-generated DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) within the c-myc oncogene or IgH locus of B lymphocytes induced for activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID)-dependent IgH class switching. DSBs translocated widely across the genome but were preferentially targeted to transcribed chromosomal regions. Additionally, numerous AID-dependent and AID-independent hot spots were targeted, with the latter comprising mainly cryptic I-SceI targets. Comparison of translocation junctions with genome-wide nuclear run-ons revealed a marked association between transcription start sites and translocation targeting. The majority of translocation junctions were formed via end-joining with short microhomologies. Our findings have implications for diverse fields, including gene therapy and cancer genomics.},

Electroporation using square-wave generating devices, like Lonza’s Nucleofector, is a widely used option, but the costs associated with the acquisition of electroporation kits and the transient transgene expression might hamper the utility of this methodology. In the present work, we show that our in-house developed buffers, termed Chicabuffers, can be efficiently used to electroporate cell lines and primary cells from murine and human origin. Using the Nucleofector II device, we electroporated 14 different cell lines and also primary cells, like mesenchymal stem cells and cord blood CD34+, providing optimized protocols for each of them. Moreover, when combined with sleeping beauty-based transposon system, long-term transgene expression could be achieved in all types of cells tested. Transgene expression was stable and did not interfere with CD34+ differentiation to committed progenitors. We also show that these buffers can be used in CRISPR-mediated editing of PDCD1 gene locus in 293T and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The optimized protocols reported in this study provide a suitable and cost-effective platform for the genetic modification of cells, facilitating the widespread adoption of this technology.},

Using a novel covalent inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7) to disrupt the transcription of amplified MYCN in neuroblastoma cells, we demonstrate downregulation of the oncoprotein with consequent massive suppression of MYCN-driven global transcriptional amplification. This response translated to significant tumor regression in a mouse model of high-risk neuroblastoma, without the introduction of systemic toxicity. The striking treatment selectivity of MYCN-overexpressing cells correlated with preferential downregulation of super-enhancer-associated genes, including MYCN and other known oncogenic drivers in neuroblastoma. These results indicate that CDK7 inhibition, by selectively targeting the mechanisms that promote global transcriptional amplification in tumor cells, may be useful therapy for cancers that are driven by MYC family oncoproteins.},

IL-4 is reported to be critical for GC formation. Centroblasts differentiated to centrocytes during the culture period of 3 days as demonstrated by the down-regulation of CD77 expression and induction of CD44 as well as Bcl-2 expression. The transition of centroblast to centrocyte was enhanced by BCR stimulation and IL-4. Upon further culture, the centrocytes differentiated to memory B cells, a process that was enhanced by BCR stimulation and IL-4. The presence of IL-4 in the culture did not increase the number of plasma cells.

  abstract = {Aims We aimed to investigate MYC expression and chromosomal aberration in mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), and the clinical significance of these factors. Methods and results Sixty-five patients with MCL, including 54 classic, nine blastoid and two pleomorphic variants, were enrolled. Expression of MYC, Ki67 and p53 was assessed by immunohistochemistry. MYC amplification or translocation was examined by fluorescence in-situ hybridization. MYC expression was higher in blastoid/pleomorphic MCL variants (mean, 19.0\%) than in classic MCL (mean, 1.9\%; P {$<$} 0.001). Expression of p53 and Ki67 was also significantly higher in these variants. MYC amplification was found in two of 53 cases tested, both of which were blastoid variants with high MYC expression (29.7\% and 20.4\%). MYC translocation was found in two of 52 cases tested, both of which were pleomorphic variants with remarkably high MYC expression (68.5\% and 71.0\%). High MYC or p53 expression was significantly associated with shortened overall survival and progression-free survival in univariable and multivariable analyses (all P {$<$} 0.05). Conclusions MYC overexpression is a negative predictor of MCL patient outcomes. MYC gene amplification or translocation might be related to the pathogenesis of MCL, particularly in blastoid/pleomorphic variants.},

Recent efforts have highlighted the critical role of follicular helper CD4 T (Tfh) cells in the generation of germinal centers. Given that Bcl6 is a major transcription factor for Tfh differentiation, here we review recent developments in the understanding of signaling molecules that regulate Bcl6 expression in CD4 T cells, as a potential target for development of more efficacious vaccines.},

  abstract = {All mature blood cells derive from hematopoietic stem cells through gradual restriction of their cell fate potential and acquisition of specialized functions. Lineage specification and cell commitment require the establishment of specific transcriptional programs involving the activation of lineage-specific genes and the repression of lineage-inappropriate genes. This process requires the concerted action of transcription factors (TFs) and epigenetic modifying enzymes. Within the hematopoietic system, B lymphopoiesis is one of the most-studied differentiation programs. Loss of function studies allowed the identification of many TFs and epigenetic modifiers required for B cell development. The usage of systematic analytical techniques such as transcriptome determination, genome-wide mapping of TF binding and epigenetic modifications, and mass spectrometry analyses, allowed to gain a systemic description of the intricate networks that guide B cell development. However, the precise mechanisms governing the interaction between TFs and chromatin are still unclear. Generally, chromatin structure can be remodeled by some TFs but in turn can also regulate (i.e., prevent or promote) the binding of other TFs. This conundrum leads to the crucial questions of who is on first, when, and how. We review here the current knowledge about TF networks and epigenetic regulation during hematopoiesis, with an emphasis on B cell development, and discuss in particular the current models about the interplay between chromatin and TFs.},

Using a high-throughput cellular screen of a diverse chemical library we observe that SCLC is sensitive to transcription-targeting drugs, and in particular to THZ1, a recent identified covalent inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7). We find that expression of super-enhancer associated transcription factor genes including MYC family proto-oncogenes and neuroendocrine lineage-specific factors are highly vulnerability to THZ1 treatment. We propose that downregulation of these transcription factors contributes, in part, to SCLC sensitivity to transcriptional inhibitors and that THZ1 represents a prototype drug for tailored SCLC therapy.},

  abstract = {Long noncoding RNAs are key regulators of chromatin states for important biological processes such as dosage compensation, imprinting, and developmental gene expression (1,2,3,4,5,6,7). The recent discovery of thousands of lncRNAs in association with specific chromatin modification complexes, such as Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) that mediates histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3), suggests broad roles for numerous lncRNAs in managing chromatin states in a gene-specific fashion (8,9). While some lncRNAs are thought to work in cis on neighboring genes, other lncRNAs work in trans to regulate distantly located genes. For instance, Drosophila lncRNAs roX1 and roX2 bind numerous regions on the X chromosome of male cells, and are critical for dosage compensation (10,11). However, the exact locations of their binding sites are not known at high resolution. Similarly, human lncRNA HOTAIR can affect PRC2 occupancy on hundreds of genes genome-wide( 3,12,13), but how specificity is achieved is unclear. LncRNAs can also serve as modular scaffolds to recruit the assembly of multiple protein complexes. The classic trans-acting RNA scaffold is the TERC RNA that serves as the template and scaffold for the telomerase complex (14); HOTAIR can also serve as a scaffold for PRC2 and a H3K4 demethylase complex (13).    Prior studies mapping RNA occupancy at chromatin have revealed substantial insights (15,16), but only at a single gene locus at a time. The occupancy sites of most lncRNAs are not known, and the roles of lncRNAs in chromatin regulation have been mostly inferred from the indirect effects of lncRNA perturbation. Just as chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by microarray or deep sequencing (ChIP-chip or ChIP-seq, respectively) has greatly improved our understanding of protein-DNA interactions on a genomic scale, here we illustrate a recently published strategy to map long RNA occupancy genome-wide at high resolution (17). This method, Chromatin Isolation by RNA Purification (ChIRP) (Figure 1), is based on affinity capture of target lncRNA:chromatin complex by tiling antisense-oligos, which then generates a map of genomic binding sites at a resolution of several hundred bases with high sensitivity and low background. ChIRP is applicable to many lncRNAs because the design of affinity-probes is straightforward given the RNA sequence and requires no knowledge of the RNA's structure or functional domains.},

  abstract = {The methylcytosine dioxygenase TET1 (‘ten-eleven translocation 1’) is an important regulator of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) in embryonic stem cells. The diminished expression of TET proteins and loss of 5hmC in many tumors suggests a critical role for the maintenance of this epigenetic modification. Here we found that deletion of Tet1 promoted the development of B cell lymphoma in mice. TET1 was required for maintenance of the normal abundance and distribution of 5hmC, which prevented hypermethylation of DNA, and for regulation of the B cell lineage and of genes encoding molecules involved in chromosome maintenance and DNA repair. Whole-exome sequencing of TET1-deficient tumors revealed mutations frequently found in non-Hodgkin B cell lymphoma (B-NHL), in which TET1 was hypermethylated and transcriptionally silenced. Our findings provide in vivo evidence of a function for TET1 as a tumor suppressor of hematopoietic malignancy.},

  abstract = {The TET methylcytosine dioxygenase 1 (TET1) enzyme is an important regulator of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) in embryonic stem cells. Decreased expression of TET proteins and loss of 5hmC in many tumors suggests a critical role for the maintenance of this epigenetic modification. Here we show that deletion of Tet1 promoted the development of B cell lymphoma in mice. Tet1 was required for maintaining normal content of 5hmC, preventing DNA hypermethylation and in the regulation of B cell lineage, chromosome maintenance and DNA repair genes. Whole-exome sequencing of Tet1-deficient tumors revealed mutations frequently found in Non-Hodgkin B cell lymphoma, where TET1 was hypermethylated and transcriptionally silenced.

  abstract = {We describe a new computer program, SnpEff, for rapidly categorizing the effects of variants in genome sequences. Once a genome is sequenced, SnpEff annotates variants based on their genomic locations and predicts coding effects. Annotated genomic locations include intronic, untranslated region, upstream, downstream, splice site, or intergenic regions. Coding effects such as synonymous or non-synonymous amino acid replacement, start codon gains or losses, stop codon gains or losses, or frame shifts can be predicted. ,  Here the use of SnpEff is illustrated by annotating \textasciitilde 356,660 candidate SNPs in \textasciitilde 117 Mb unique sequences, representing a substitution rate of \textasciitilde 1/305 nucleotides, between the Drosophila melanogaster w1118; iso-2; iso-3 strain and the reference y1; cn1 bw1 sp1 strain. We show that \textasciitilde 15,842 SNPs are synonymous and \textasciitilde 4,467 SNPs are non-synonymous (N/S \textasciitilde 0.28). The remaining SNPs are in other categories, such as stop codon gains (38 SNPs), stop codon losses (8 SNPs), and start codon gains (297 SNPs) in the 5′UTR. We found, as expected, that the SNP frequency is proportional to the recombination frequency (i.e., highest in the middle of chromosome arms). We also found that start-gain or stop-lost SNPs in Drosophila melanogaster often result in additions of N-terminal or C-terminal amino acids that are conserved in other Drosophila species. It appears that the 5′ and 3′ UTRs are reservoirs for genetic variations that changes the termini of proteins during evolution of the Drosophila genus.,  As genome sequencing is becoming inexpensive and routine, SnpEff enables rapid analyses of whole-genome sequencing data to be performed by an individual laboratory.},

We have collected 241 cases under 4 years of age, and carried out histologic review, methylation profiling, and custom panel, genome, or exome sequencing. After excluding tumors representing other established entities or subgroups, we identified 130 cases to be part of an “intrinsic” spectrum of disease specific to the infant population.

Because most nonfollicular B-cell lymphomas also express the CD20 antigen, we conducted a phase II study to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of this new agent in patients with more aggressive types of lymphoma. Patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLCL), mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), or other intermediate- or high-grade B-cell lymphomas according to the Working Formulation were included in this prospective randomized phase II study if they were in first or second relapse, if they were refractory to initial therapy, if they progressed after a partial response to initial therapy, or if they were elderly (age {$>$}60 years) and not previously treated. The patients received 8 weekly infusions of rituximab at the dose of 375 mg/m2 in arm A or one infusion of 375 mg/m2 followed by 7 weekly infusions of 500 mg/m2 in arm B. Patients were evaluated 2 months after the last rituximab infusion. Fifty-four patients were randomized from 9 centers in Europe and Australia (28 in arm A and 26 in arm B). A total of 5 complete responses (CR) and 12 partial responses (PR) were observed among the 54 enrolled patients, with no difference between the two doses. In an intent-to-treat analysis, the CR rate was 9\% (CI95\%, 3\% to 20\%) and the PR rate was 22\% (CI95\%, 12\% to 36\%), for an overall response rate of 31\% (CI95\%, 20\% to 46\%). An analysis of prognostic factors showed that response rates were lower in patients with refractory disease, patients with lymphoma not classified as DLCL, and patients with a tumor larger than 5 cm in diameter. DLCL and MCL patients had response rates of 37\% and 33\%, respectively. The median time to progression exceeded 246 days for the 17 responding patients. The most frequently reported adverse events were related to an infusion syndrome and were mild: 19\% of the patients had a grade 3 related adverse event, slightly more in arm B, and only 1 patient had a grade 4 related adverse event in arm A. Two patients (3.7\%) withdrew from treatment because of severe adverse events, one patient in each arm. In this first trial of rituximab in DLCL and MCL, patients experienced a significant clinical activity with a low toxicity. Rituximab has significant activity in DLCL and MCL patients and should be tested in combination with chemotherapy in such patients. © 1998 by The American Society of Hematology.},

Cas9 can also be converted into a nicking enzyme to facilitate homology-directed repair with minimal mutagenic activity. Lastly, multiple guide sequences can be encoded into a single CRISPR array to enable simultaneous editing of several sites within the mammalian genome, demonstrating easy programmability and wide applicability of the RNA-guided nuclease technology.},

These data enabled us to assign biochemical functions for 80\% of the genome, in particular outside of the well-studied protein-coding regions. Many discovered candidate regulatory elements are physically associated with one another and with expressed genes, providing new insights into the mechanisms of gene regulation. The newly identified elements also show a statistical correspondence to sequence variants linked to human disease, and can thereby guide interpretation of this variation. Overall, the project provides new insights into the organization and regulation of our genes and genome, and is an expansive resource of functional annotations for biomedical research.},

The ENCODE Consortium, a large group of scientists from around the world, uses a variety of experimental methods to identify and describe the regions of the 3 billion base-pair human genome that are important for function. Using experimental, computational, and statistical analyses, we aimed to discover and describe genes, transcripts, and transcriptional regulatory regions, as well as DNA binding proteins that interact with regulatory regions in the genome, including transcription factors, different versions of histones and other markers, and DNA methylation patterns that define states of the genome in various cell types. The ENCODE Project has developed standards for each experiment type to ensure high-quality, reproducible data and novel algorithms to facilitate analysis. All data and derived results are made available through a freely accessible database. This article provides an overview of the complete project and the resources it is generating, as well as examples to illustrate the application of ENCODE data as a user's guide to facilitate the interpretation of the human genome.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION Chromosome conformation capture (3C) is a technique used to detect the spatial organization of chromosomal DNA in fixed cells. DNA sequences in spatial proximity in the nucleus or engaged in physical interactions (such as those between genes and regulatory elements) can be assessed quantitatively to provide a measure that potentially reflects their frequency of association and/or their proximity. 3C can be used to study long-range interactions between DNA sequences on the same chromosome (intrachromosomal) or between different chromosomes (interchromosomal). Briefly, chromatin fragments in proximity are fixed with formaldehyde, followed by digestion with restriction enzymes, nuclear lysis, dilution of the cross-linked complexes, and intramolecular ligation. The cross-links are subsequently removed and the DNA is purified. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is then used to amplify DNA fragments containing novel ligation junctions using primers specific for a pair of DNA sequences under investigation. Here we describe a detailed 3C protocol and experimental controls that can be applied to investigate the nuclear juxtaposition of any two genomic regions, in cis or trans.},

Exploiting the finding that the enhancer landscape better reflects cell identity than mRNA levels, we enable 'enhancer cytometry' for enumeration of pure cell types from complex populations. We identify regulators governing hematopoietic differentiation and further show the lineage ontogeny of genetic elements linked to diverse human diseases. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), chromatin accessibility uncovers unique regulatory evolution in cancer cells with a progressively increasing mutation burden. Single AML cells exhibit distinctive mixed regulome profiles corresponding to disparate developmental stages. A method to account for this regulatory heterogeneity identified cancer-specific deviations and implicated HOX factors as key regulators of preleukemic hematopoietic stem cell characteristics. Thus, regulome dynamics can provide diverse insights into hematopoietic development and disease.},

Here we review recent findings of how the cancer genome is regulated and dysregulated to effect changes in 3D genome topology. We discuss the impact of the spatial organization of the genome on the frequency of tumorigenic chromosomal translocations and the effects of disruption of the proteins responsible for the establishment of chromatin loops.

  abstract = {The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was first documented in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) in 2012 and, to date, has been identified in 180 cases with 43\% mortality. In this study, we have determined the MERS-CoV evolutionary rate, documented genetic variants of the virus and their distribution throughout the Arabian peninsula, and identified the genome positions under positive selection, important features for monitoring adaptation of MERS-CoV to human transmission and for identifying the source of infections. Respiratory samples from confirmed KSA MERS cases from May to September 2013 were subjected to whole-genome deep sequencing, and 32 complete or partial sequences (20 were ≥99\% complete, 7 were 50 to 94\% complete, and 5 were 27 to 50\% complete) were obtained, bringing the total available MERS-CoV genomic sequences to 65. An evolutionary rate of 1.12 × 10−3 substitutions per site per year (95\% credible interval [95\% CI], 8.76 × 10−4; 1.37 × 10−3) was estimated, bringing the time to most recent common ancestor to March 2012 (95\% CI, December 2011; June 2012). Only one MERS-CoV codon, spike 1020, located in a domain required for cell entry, is under strong positive selection. Four KSA MERS-CoV phylogenetic clades were found, with 3 clades apparently no longer contributing to current cases. The size of the population infected with MERS-CoV showed a gradual increase to June 2013, followed by a decline, possibly due to increased surveillance and infection control measures combined with a basic reproduction number (R0) for the virus that is less than 1. IMPORTANCE MERS-CoV adaptation toward higher rates of sustained human-to-human transmission appears not to have occurred yet. While MERS-CoV transmission currently appears weak, careful monitoring of changes in MERS-CoV genomes and of the MERS epidemic should be maintained. The observation of phylogenetically related MERS-CoV in geographically diverse locations must be taken into account in efforts to identify the animal source and transmission of the virus.},

Next-generation sequencing (NGS) allows rapid analysis of multiple genes for clinically actionable somatic variants. The WUCaMP assay uses targeted capture for NGS analysis of 25 cancer-associated genes to detect mutations at actionable loci. We present clinical validation of the assay and a detailed framework for design and validation of similar clinical assays. Deep sequencing of 78 tumor specimens (≥ 1000× average unique coverage across the capture region) achieved high sensitivity for detecting somatic variants at low allele fraction (AF). Validation revealed sensitivities and specificities of 100\% for detection of single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) within coding regions, compared with SNP array sequence data (95\% CI = 83.4-100.0 for sensitivity and 94.2-100.0 for specificity) or whole-genome sequencing (95\% CI = 89.1-100.0 for sensitivity and 99.9-100.0 for specificity) of HapMap samples. Sensitivity for detecting variants at an observed 10\% AF was 100\% (95\% CI = 93.2-100.0) in HapMap mixes. Analysis of 15 masked specimens harboring clinically reported variants yielded concordant calls for 13/13 variants at AF of ≥ 15\%. The WUCaMP assay is a robust and sensitive method to detect somatic variants of clinical significance in molecular oncology laboratories, with reduced time and cost of genetic analysis allowing for strategic patient management.},

Our understanding of these processes, and how they relate to glioblastoma heterogeneity, is limited. To overcome these limitations, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing on 53586 adult glioblastoma cells and 22637 normal human fetal brain cells, and compared the lineage hierarchy of the developing human brain to the transcriptome of cancer cells. We find a conserved neural tri-lineage cancer hierarchy centered around glial progenitor-like cells. We also find that this progenitor population contains the majority of the cancer’s cycling cells, and, using RNA velocity, is often the originator of the other cell types. Finally, we show that this hierarchal map can be used to identify therapeutic targets specific to progenitor cancer stem cells. Our analyses show that normal brain development reconciles glioblastoma development, suggests a possible origin for glioblastoma hierarchy, and helps to identify cancer stem cell-specific targets.},

Here, we use single-cell RNA-sequencing and multiplexed tissue-imaging to characterize the composition, spatial organization, and clinical significance of extracellular purinergic signaling in glioma. We show that microglia are the predominant source of CD39, while tumor cells principally express CD73. In glioblastoma, CD73 is associated with EGFR amplification, astrocyte-like differentiation, and increased adenosine, and is linked to hypoxia. Glioblastomas enriched for CD73 exhibit inflammatory microenvironments, suggesting that purinergic signaling regulates immune adaptation. Spatially-resolved single-cell analyses demonstrate a strong spatial correlation between tumor-CD73 and microglial-CD39, with proximity associated with poor outcomes. Similar spatial organization is present in pediatric high-grade gliomas including H3K27M-mutant diffuse midline glioma. These data reveal that purinergic signaling in gliomas is shaped by genotype, lineage, and functional state, and that core enzymes expressed by tumor and myeloid cells are organized to promote adenosine-rich microenvironments potentially amenable to therapeutic targeting.},

  abstract = {A major goal in genomics is to understand how genes are regulated in different tissues, stages of development, diseases, and species. Mapping DNase I hypersensitive (HS) sites within nuclear chromatin is a powerful and well-established method of identifying many different types of regulatory elements, but in the past it has been limited to analysis of single loci. We have recently described a protocol to generate a genome-wide library of DNase HS sites. Here, we report high-throughput analysis, using massively parallel signature sequencing (MPSS), of 230,000 tags from a DNase library generated from quiescent human CD4+ T cells. Of the tags that uniquely map to the genome, we identified 14,190 clusters of sequences that group within close proximity to each other. By using a real-time PCR strategy, we determined that the majority of these clusters represent valid DNase HS sites. Approximately 80\% of these DNase HS sites uniquely map within one or more annotated regions of the genome believed to contain regulatory elements, including regions 2 kb upstream of genes, CpG islands, and highly conserved sequences. Most DNase HS sites identified in CD4+ T cells are also HS in CD8+ T cells, B cells, hepatocytes, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), and HeLa cells. However, ∼10\% of the DNase HS sites are lymphocyte specific, indicating that this procedure can identify gene regulatory elements that control cell type specificity. This strategy, which can be applied to any cell line or tissue, will enable a better understanding of how chromatin structure dictates cell function and fate.},

TADs are considered to be relatively stable three-dimensional (3D) genomic structures orchestrating gene expression regulation; yet, many dynamically reorganize during development or disease, and exhibit cell- and condition-specific differences. Quantification of the dynamic behavior of TADs will help to better understand genome regulation. Methods for comparing TADs between cells and conditions are highly limited. We developed TADCompare, a method for differential analysis of TAD boundaries between Hi-C datasets. TADCompare is based on a spectral clustering-derived measure called the eigenvector gap, which enables a loci-by-loci comparison of TAD boundary differences between datasets. Using this measure, we introduce methods for identifying differential and consensus TAD boundaries, and tracking TAD boundary changes over time. We further propose a novel framework for the systematic classification of TAD boundary changes. Colocalization- and gene enrichment analysis of different types of TAD boundary changes demonstrated distinct biological functionality associated with them. TADCompare is available on https://github.com/dozmorovlab/TADCompare and Bioconductor (submitted).},

TFH cells are important for the formation of germinal centers. Once germinal centers are formed, TFH cells are needed to maintain them and to regulate germinal center B cell differentiation into plasma cells and memory B cells. This review covers TFH differentiation, TFH functions, and human TFH cells, discussing recent progress and areas of uncertainty or disagreement in the literature, and it debates the developmental relationship between TFH cells and other CD4 T cell subsets (Th1, Th2, Th17, iTreg).},

  abstract = {Altered DNA methylation and associated destabilization of genome integrity and function is a hallmark of cancer. Replicative senescence is a tumour suppressor process that imposes a limit on the proliferative potential of normal cells that all cancer cells must bypass. Here we show by whole-genome single-nucleotide bisulfite sequencing that replicative senescent human cells exhibit widespread DNA hypomethylation and focal hypermethylation. Hypomethylation occurs preferentially at gene-poor, late-replicating, lamin-associated domains and is linked to mislocalization of the maintenance DNA methyltransferase (DNMT1) in cells approaching senescence. Low-level gains of methylation are enriched in CpG islands, including at genes whose methylation and silencing is thought to promote cancer. Gains and losses of methylation in replicative senescence are thus qualitatively similar to those in cancer, and this ‘reprogrammed’ methylation landscape is largely retained when cells bypass senescence. Consequently, the DNA methylome of senescent cells might promote malignancy, if these cells escape the proliferative barrier.},

  abstract = {Purpose of review~The three-dimensional organization of the genome inside the nucleus impacts on key aspects of genome function, including transcription, DNA replication and repair. The chromosome maintenance complex cohesin and the DNA binding protein CTCF cooperate to drive the formation of self-interacting topological domains. This facilitates transcriptional regulation via enhancer–promoter interactions, controls the distribution and release of torsional strain, and affects the frequency with which particular translocations arise, based on the spatial proximity of translocation partners. Here we discuss recent insights into the mechanisms of three-dimensional genome organization, their relationship to haematopoietic differentiation and malignant transformation.         Recent findings~Cohesin mutations are frequently found in myeloid malignancies. Significantly, cohesin mutations can drive increased self-renewal of haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, which may facilitate the accumulation of genetic lesions and leukaemic transformation. It is therefore important to elucidate the mechanisms that link cohesin to pathways that regulate the balance between self-renewal and differentiation. Chromosomal translocations are key to lymphoid malignancies, and recent findings link three-dimensional genome organization to the frequency and the genomic position of DNA double strand breaks.         Summary~Three-dimensional genome organization can help explain genome function in normal and malignant haematopoiesis.},

Although activation of naïve T cells results in proliferation and slow differentiation into cytokine-producing effector cells, antigen engagement with memory cells leads to cytokine production immediately. Even though the cell surface signaling events are similar in both the cases, the outcome is different, suggesting that distinct regulatory mechanisms may exist downstream of the activation signals. Recent advances in the understanding of global epigenetic patterns in T cells have resulted in the appreciation of the role of epigenetic mechanisms in processes such as activation and differentiation. In this review we discuss recent data suggesting that naïve T cell activation, differentiation, and lineage commitment result in epigenetic changes and a fine balance between different histone modifications is required. On the other hand, memory T cells are poised and do not require epigenetic changes for short-term activation.},

  abstract = {Insulators are DNA elements that prevent inappropriate interactions between the neighboring regions of the genome. They can be functionally classified as either enhancer blockers or domain barriers. CTCF (CCCTC-binding factor) is the only known major insulator-binding protein in the vertebrates and has been shown to bind many enhancer-blocking elements. However, it is not clear whether it plays a role in chromatin domain barriers between active and repressive domains. Here, we used ChIP-seq to map the genome-wide binding sites of CTCF in three cell types and identified significant binding of CTCF to the boundaries of repressive chromatin domains marked by H3K27me3. Although we find an extensive overlapping of CTCF-binding sites across the three cell types, its association with the domain boundaries is cell-type-specific. We further show that the nucleosomes flanking CTCF-binding sites are well positioned. Interestingly, we found a complementary pattern between the repressive H3K27me3 and the active H2AK5ac regions, which are separated by CTCF. Our data indicate that CTCF may play important roles in the barrier activity of insulators, and this study provides a resource for further investigation of the CTCF function in organizing chromatin in the human genome.},

CLL with high-level miR-155 expressed lower levels of Src homology-2 domain-containing inositol 5-phosphatase 1 and were more responsive to B-cell receptor (BCR) ligation than CLL with low-level miR-155. Transfection with miR-155 enhanced responsiveness to BCR ligation, whereas transfection with a miR-155 inhibitor had the opposite effect. CLL in lymphoid tissue expressed higher levels of miR155HG than CLL in the blood of the same patient. Also, isolated CD5brightCXCR4dim cells, representing CLL that had been newly released from the microenvironment, expressed higher levels of miR-155 and were more responsive to BCR ligation than isolated CD5dimCXCR4bright cells of the same patient. Treatment of CLL or normal B cells with CD40-ligand or B-cell–activating factor upregulated miR-155 and enhanced sensitivity to BCR ligation, effects that could be blocked by inhibitors to miR-155. This study demonstrates that the sensitivity to BCR ligation can be enhanced by high-level expression of miR-155, which in turn can be induced by crosstalk within the tissue microenvironment, potentially contributing to its association with adverse clinical outcome in patients with CLL.},

  abstract = {The presence and degree of peripheral blood involvement in patients with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) portend a worse clinical outcome. Available systemic therapies for CTCL may variably decrease tumor burden and improve quality of life, but offer limited effects on survival; thus, novel approaches to the treatment of advanced stages of this non-Hodgkin lymphoma are clearly warranted. Mutational analyses of CTCL patient peripheral blood malignant cell samples suggested the antiapoptotic mediator B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2) as a potential therapeutic target. To test this, we developed a screening assay for evaluating the sensitivity of CTCL cells to targeted molecular agents, and compared a novel BCL2 inhibitor, venetoclax, alone and in combination with a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, vorinostat or romidepsin. Peripheral blood CTCL malignant cells were isolated from 25 patients and exposed ex vivo to the 3 drugs alone and in combination, and comparisons were made to 4 CTCL cell lines (Hut78, Sez4, HH, MyLa). The majority of CTCL patient samples were sensitive to venetoclax, and BCL2 expression levels were negatively correlated (r = −0.52; P = .018) to 50\% inhibitory concentration values. Furthermore, this anti-BCL2 effect was markedly potentiated by concurrent HDAC inhibition with 93\% of samples treated with venetoclax and vorinostat and 73\% of samples treated with venetoclax and romidepsin showing synergistic effects. These data strongly suggest that concurrent BCL2 and HDAC inhibition may offer synergy in the treatment of patients with advanced CTCL. By using combination therapies and correlating response to gene expression in this way, we hope to achieve more effective and personalized treatments for CTCL.},

To define mechanisms associated with rituximab resistance, we developed various rituximab-resistant cell lines (RRCL) and studied changes in CD20 expression/structure, lipid raft domain (LRD) reorganization, calcium mobilization, antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, and complement-mediated cytotoxicity (CMC) between parental and RRCL. Significant changes in surface CD20 antigen expression were shown in RRCL. Decreased calcium mobilization and redistribution of CD20 into LRD were found in RRCL. Western blotting identified a unique 35 kDa protein band in RRCL, which was not seen in parental cells and was secondary to an increase in surface and cytoplasmic expression of IgM light chains. CD20 gene expression was decreased in RRCL. In vitro exposure to PS341 increased CD20 expression in RRCL and minimally improved the sensitivity to rituximab-associated CMC. Our data strongly suggest that the acquisition of rituximab resistance is associated with global gene and protein down-regulation of the CD20 antigen affecting LRD organization and downstream signaling. CD20 expression seems to be regulated at the pretranscriptional and posttranscriptional levels. Proteasome inhibition partially reversed rituximab resistance, suggesting the existence of additional mediators of rituximab resistance. Future research is geared to identify drugs and/or biological agents that are effective against RRCL.},

At the molecular level, we find that while verteporfin-induced YAP inhibition leads to apoptosis, torin1-mediated mTORC1/2 inhibition promotes macropinocytosis. Torin1-induced macropinocytosis further facilitates verteporfin uptake, thereby greatly enhancing its pro-apoptotic effects in cancer cells.

  abstract = {More than one-half billion people are obese, and despite progress in genetic research, much of the~heritability of obesity remains enigmatic. Here, we identify a Trim28-dependent network capable of triggering obesity in a non-Mendelian, “on/off” manner. Trim28+/D9 mutant mice exhibit a bi-modal body-weight distribution, with isogenic animals randomly emerging as either normal or obese and few intermediates. We find that the obese-“on” state is characterized by reduced expression of an imprinted gene network including Nnat, Peg3, Cdkn1c, and Plagl1 and that independent targeting of these alleles recapitulates the stochastic bi-stable disease phenotype. Adipose tissue transcriptome analyses in children indicate that humans too cluster into distinct sub-populations, stratifying according to Trim28 expression, transcriptome organization, and obesity-associated imprinted gene dysregulation. These data provide evidence of discrete polyphenism in mouse and man and thus carry important implications for complex trait genetics, evolution, and medicine.,},

This form of activation triggered early cytosolic signaling and the transcription factor NF-κB activation indistinguishably from conventional continuous IgM crosslinking but did not induce G1 progression. However, single round IgM signaling changed the expression of chemokine and chemokine receptor genes implicated in initiating T-dependent responses, as well as accentuated responsiveness to CD40 signaling. Several features of single-round IgM signaling in~vitro were recapitulated in B cells after short-term exposure to antigen in~vivo. We propose that transient BCR signals prime B cells to receive T~cell help by increasing the probability of B-T encounter and creating a cellular environment that is hyper-responsive to CD40 signaling.},

Using deep sequencing of flow-sorted cell populations from chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients, we established the presence of acquired mutations in multipotent hematopoietic progenitors of CLL patients. Mutations affected known lymphoid oncogenes including BRAF, NOTCH1 and SF3B1. NFKBIE and EGR2 mutations were observed at unexpected high frequencies, 10.7\% and 8.3\% of 168 advanced stage patients, respectively. EGR2 mutations were associated with a shorter time to treatment and poor overall survival. Analyses of BRAF and EGR2 mutation suggest they affect deregulation of BCR intracellular signaling. Our data propose deregulation of hematopoietic and early B-cell differentiation through the deregulation of pre-BCR signaling as a phenotypic convergence of CLL mutations and show that CLL develops from a pre-leukemic phase.},

Targeted homozygous deletion of the murine c-myc gene results in embryonic lethality, suggesting that it is critical for development (43).

Here, we report the development of an unbiased method for computational integration of copy number variation, expression, and mutation data from large datasets. Using this method, we identified rhophilin 2 (RHPN2) as a central genetic determinant of the mesenchymal phenotype of human GBM. Notably, amplification of the human RHPN2 gene on chromosome 19 correlates with a dramatic decrease in the survival of patients with glioma. Ectopic expression of RHPN2 in neural stem cells and astrocytes triggered the expression of mesenchymal genes and promoted an invasive phenotype without impacting cell proliferation. Mechanistically, these effects were implemented through RHPN2-mediated activation of RhoA, a master regulator of cell migration and invasion. Our results define RHPN2 amplification as a central genetic determinant of a highly aggressive phenotype that directs the worst clinical outcomes in patients with GBM.

The innate immune recognition of bacterial and viral products is mediated by a family of transmembrane receptors known as Toll-like receptors (TLRs). In endothelial cells, exposure to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a major cell wall constituent of Gram-negative bacteria, results in endothelial activation through a receptor complex consisting of TLR4, CD14 and MD2. Recruitment of the adaptor protein myeloid differentiation factor (MyD88) initiates an MyD88-dependent pathway that culminates in the early activation of nuclear factor-B (NF-B) and the mitogen-activated protein kinases. In parallel, a MyD88-independent pathway results in a late-phase activation of NF-B. The outcome is the production of various proinflammatory mediators and ultimately cellular injury, leading to the various vascular sequelae of sepsis. This review will focus on the signaling pathways initiated by LPS binding to the TLR4 receptor in endothelial cells and the coordinated regulation of this pathway.},

Patients with one DLBCL subtype, termed activated B cell–like (ABC) DLBCL, have a distinctly inferior prognosis. An untapped potential of gene expression profiling is its ability to identify pathogenic signaling pathways in cancer that are amenable to therapeutic attack. The gene expression profiles of ABC DLBCLs were notable for the high expression of target genes of the nuclear factor (NF)-κB transcription factors, raising the possibility that constitutive activity of the NF-κB pathway may contribute to the poor prognosis of these patients. Two cell line models of ABC DLBCL had high nuclear NF-κB DNA binding activity, constitutive IκB kinase (IKK) activity, and rapid IκBα degradation that was not seen in cell lines representing the other DLBCL subtype, germinal center B-like (GCB) DLBCL. Retroviral transduction of a super-repressor form of IκBα or dominant negative forms of IKKβ was toxic to ABC DLBCL cells but not GCB DLBCL cells. DNA content analysis showed that NF-κB inhibition caused both cell death and G1-phase growth arrest. These findings establish the NF-κB pathway as a new molecular target for drug development in the most clinically intractable subtype of DLBCL and demonstrate that the two DLBCL subtypes defined by gene expression profiling utilize distinct pathogenetic mechanisms.},

Here we studied genome-wide DNA methylation in normal B-cell populations and subtypes of B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma: follicular lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphomas. These lymphomas display striking and progressive intra-tumor heterogeneity and also inter-patient heterogeneity in their cytosine methylation patterns. Epigenetic heterogeneity is initiated in normal germinal center B-cells, increases markedly with disease aggressiveness, and is associated with unfavorable clinical outcome. Moreover, patterns of abnormal methylation vary depending upon chromosomal regions, gene density and the status of neighboring genes. DNA methylation abnormalities arise via two distinct processes: i) lymphomagenic transcriptional regulators perturb promoter DNA methylation in a target gene-specific manner, and ii) aberrant epigenetic states tend to spread to neighboring promoters in the absence of CTCF insulator binding sites., Follicular lymphomas and diffuse large B-cell lymphomas are the most common non-Hodgkin lymphomas.

A total of 314 protein–protein interactions between HCV and human proteins was identified by yeast two-hybrid and 170 by literature mining. Integration of this data set into a reconstructed human interactome showed that cellular proteins interacting with HCV are enriched in highly central and interconnected proteins. A global analysis on the basis of functional annotation highlighted the enrichment of cellular pathways targeted by HCV. A network of proteins associated with frequent clinical disorders of chronically infected patients was constructed by connecting the insulin, Jak/STAT and TGFβ pathways with cellular proteins targeted by HCV. CORE protein appeared as a major perturbator of this network. Focal adhesion was identified as a new function affected by HCV, mainly by NS3 and NS5A proteins.},

  abstract = {Summary Pax5 is an essential regulator of B cell identity and function. Here, we used transgenesis and deletion mapping to identify a potent enhancer in intron 5 of the Pax5 locus. This enhancer in combination with~the promoter region was sufficient to recapitulate the B~lymphoid expression of Pax5. The enhancer was silenced by DNA methylation in embryonic stem cells, but became activated in multipotent hematopoietic progenitors. It contained functional binding sites for~the transcription factors PU.1, IRF4, IRF8, and NF-κB, suggesting that these regulators contribute to sequential enhancer activation in hematopoietic progenitors and during B cell development. In contrast, the promoter region was repressed by Polycomb group proteins in non-B cells and was activated only at the onset of pro-B cell development through induction of chromatin remodeling by the transcription factor EBF1. These experiments demonstrate a stepwise activation of Pax5 in early lymphopoiesis and provide mechanistic insights into the process of B cell commitment.},

Generation of a matrix of interaction frequencies between sites on the same or different chromosomes reveals their relative spatial disposition and provides information about the physical properties of the chromatin fiber. This methodology can be applied to the spatial organization of entire genomes in organisms from bacteria to human. Using the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we could confirm known qualitative features of chromosome organization within the nucleus and dynamic changes in that organization during meiosis. We also analyzed yeast chromosome III at the G1stage of the cell cycle. We found that chromatin is highly flexible throughout. Furthermore, functionally distinct AT- and GC-rich domains were found to exhibit different conformations, and a population-average 3D model of chromosome III could be determined. Chromosome III emerges as a contorted ring.},

Recent evidence shows that long-range control of gene expression can be mediated through direct physical interactions between genes and these regulatory elements. Such looping interactions can be detected using the chromosome conformation capture (3C) methodology3.

  abstract = {Summary MYC contributes to the pathogenesis of a majority of human cancers, yet strategies to modulate the function of the c-Myc oncoprotein do not exist. Toward this objective, we have targeted MYC transcription by interfering with chromatin-dependent signal transduction to RNA polymerase, specifically by inhibiting the acetyl-lysine recognition domains (bromodomains) of putative coactivator proteins implicated in transcriptional initiation and elongation. Using~a selective small-molecule bromodomain inhibitor, JQ1, we identify BET bromodomain proteins as regulatory factors for c-Myc. BET inhibition by JQ1 downregulates MYC transcription, followed by genome-wide downregulation of Myc-dependent target genes. In experimental models of multiple myeloma, a Myc-dependent hematologic malignancy, JQ1 produces a potent antiproliferative effect associated with cell-cycle arrest and cellular senescence. Efficacy of JQ1 in three murine models of multiple myeloma establishes the therapeutic rationale for BET bromodomain inhibition in this disease and other malignancies characterized by pathologic activation of c-Myc.

  abstract = {The regulation of the rate of transcription of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 is mainly exerted through the long terminal repeat (LTR) at the 5' end of the provirus. A large number of cis-acting regulatory elements have been identified in the LTR by in vitro binding studies; the biological role of these sites within living infected cells, however, is still not clear. We have studied the interactions of nuclear proteins with the LTR in the U1 monocytic cell line by in vivo dimethylsulfate footprinting, using the ligation-mediated polymerase chain reaction technique. In this cell line, transcription of the virus, which is very low under basal conditions, is highly inducible by treatment with phorbol esters; therefore, this system is likely to represent a suitable cellular model to study viral latency. Independently of the level of viral transcription, major in vivo footprints appear at the two Sp1 sites adjacent to the enhancer, the downstream-positioned enhancer repeat, the NFAT binding site, and one of the purine-rich sites of the negative regulatory element. Upon transcriptional activation by phorbol myristate acetate, the only perturbation in the footprinting pattern is a dramatic increase in dimethylsulfate sensitivity of guanine at position -92 in the downstream enhancer repeat. This modification is correlated with the transient induction of two enhancer-binding activities, as determined by gel retardation assays. While the transcriptional rate is still increasing and the in vivo footprinting pattern is unchanged at up to 24 h postactivation, these enhancer-binding factors are considerably reduced at this time. Therefore, further levels of regulation have to be considered to explain the maintenance of the induced state.},

The first decade of 3C methods rendered unprecedented insights into genome topology. Here, we provide an update of developments and discoveries made over the more recent years. As we discuss, established and newly developed experimental and computational methods enabled identification of novel, functionally important chromosome structures. Regulatory and architectural chromatin loops throughout the genome are being cataloged and compared between cell types, revealing tissue invariant and developmentally dynamic loops. Architectural proteins shaping the genome were disclosed, and their mode of action is being uncovered. We explain how more detailed insights into the 3D genome increase our understanding of transcriptional regulation in development and misregulation in disease. Finally, to help researchers in choosing the approach best tailored for their specific research question, we explain the differences and commonalities between the various 3C-derived methods.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Pilocytic Astrocytomas (PAs) are common low-grade central nervous system malignancies for which few recurrent and specific genetic alterations have been identified. In an effort to better understand the molecular biology underlying the pathogenesis of these pediatric brain tumors, we performed higher-order transcriptional network analysis of a large gene expression dataset to identify gene regulatory pathways that are specific to this tumor type, relative to other, more aggressive glial or histologically distinct brain tumours. METHODS: RNA derived from frozen human PA tumours was subjected to microarray-based gene expression profiling, using Affymetrix U133Plus2 GeneChip microarrays. This data set was compared to similar data sets previously generated from non-malignant human brain tissue and other brain tumour types, after appropriate normalization. RESULTS: In this study, we examined gene expression in 66 PA tumors compared to 15 non-malignant cortical brain tissues, and identified 792 genes that demonstrated consistent differential expression between independent sets of PA and non-malignant specimens. From this entire 792 gene set, we used the previously described PAP tool to assemble a core transcriptional regulatory network composed of 6 transcription factor genes (TFs) and 24 target genes, for a total of 55 interactions. A similar analysis of oligodendroglioma and glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) gene expression data sets identified distinct, but overlapping, networks. Most importantly, comparison of each of the brain tumor type-specific networks revealed a network unique to PA that included repressed expression of ONECUT2, a gene frequently methylated in other tumor types, and 13 other uniquely predicted TF-gene interactions. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest specific transcriptional pathways that may operate to create the unique molecular phenotype of PA and thus opportunities for corresponding targeted therapeutic intervention. Moreover, this study also demonstrates how integration of gene expression data with TF-gene and TF-TF interaction data is a powerful approach to generating testable hypotheses to better understand cell-type specific genetic programs relevant to cancer.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) is a heterogeneous group of skin-homing T-cell neoplasms, which represent approximately 75\% of all primary cutaneous lymphomas. Currently available drug therapies, when effective, simply control disease and the only option for curing CTCL is stem cell transplant. RECENT FINDINGS: In the last year, there has been an incredible effort made to improve the understanding and treatment of CTCL. Recent findings indicate that epigenetic aberrations are integral to active disease. Furthermore, multiple tumor-derived immunological factors have also been shown to inhibit viability, proliferation, and cytokine production of nonmalignant T cells. Several novel targeted therapies show great potential, most promising being antibody drug conjugates targeting surface markers such as CD30 in some CTCL subtypes. Additional attractive targets involve the global modulation of epigenetic markers such as demethylation agents or HDAC inhibitors, either as single agents or in combination therapies. SUMMARY: This is a concise review of recent advances in the field of CTCL with special focus on research articles over the preceding year.},

Although chromatin decompaction and transcriptional activation of target genes are associated with BRD4 binding, the mechanisms involved are unknown. We report that BRD4 is a histone acetyltransferase (HAT) that acetylates histones H3 and H4 with a pattern distinct from those of other HATs. Both mouse and human BRD4 have intrinsic HAT activity. Importantly, BRD4 acetylates H3 K122, a residue critical for nucleosome stability, thus resulting in nucleosome eviction and chromatin decompaction. Nucleosome clearance by BRD4 occurs genome wide, including at its targets MYC, FOS and AURKB (Aurora B kinase), resulting in increased transcription. These findings suggest a model wherein BRD4 actively links chromatin structure and transcription: it mediates chromatin decompaction by acetylating and evicting nucleosomes at target genes, thereby activating transcription.},

A major attempt to restore β-cell mass and normoglycemia is to improve β-cell survival. Here we show that switching off the Fas pathway using Fas apoptotic inhibitory protein (Faim/TOSO), which regulates apoptosis upstream of caspase 8, blocked β-cell apoptosis and increased proliferation in human islets. TOSO was clearly expressed in pancreatic β-cells and down-regulated in T2DM. TOSO expression correlated with β-cell turnover; at conditions of improved survival, TOSO was induced. In contrast, TOSO downregulation induced β-cell apoptosis. Although TOSO overexpression resulted in a 3-fold induction of proliferation, proliferating β-cells showed a very limited capacity to undergo multiple rounds of replication. Our data suggest that TOSO is an important regulator of β-cell turnover and switches β-cell apoptosis into proliferation.},

Here, we show that differential usage of the genomic repertoire of transcriptional enhancers leads to grade-specific gene expression programs in human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). By integrating gene expression profiling, epigenomic footprinting, and loss-of-function experiments in PDAC cell lines of different grade, we identified the repertoires of enhancers specific to high- and low-grade PDACs and the cognate set of transcription factors acting to maintain their activity. Among the candidate regulators of PDAC differentiation, KLF5 was selectively expressed in pre-neoplastic lesions and low-grade primary PDACs and cell lines, where it maintained the acetylation of grade-specific enhancers, the expression of epithelial genes such as keratins and mucins, and the ability to organize glandular epithelia in xenografts. The identification of the transcription factors controlling differentiation in PDACs will help clarify the molecular bases of its heterogeneity and progression.},

  abstract = {The occurrence of large cell transformation has been well documented in a subgroup of patients with mycosis fungoides/Sezary syndrome (MF/SS). However, because of the rarity of MF/SS, little is known about the influence of clinicopathologic features in predicting large cell transformation and about outcome in the transformed cases. We evaluated all patients with MF/SS who were registered in our clinic during the study period and for whom pathologic slides for review were available or could be obtained. Disease was classified as transformed if biopsy showed large cells (≥4 times the size of a small lymphocyte) in more than 25\% of the infiltrate or if they formed microscopic nodules. Twenty-six patients with transformation were identified from a total of 115 evaluable cases with a diagnosis of MF/SS. The actuarial cumulative probability of transformation reached 39\% in 12 years. The median time from diagnosis of MF/SS to transformation was 12 months (range, 0 to 128 months). Thirty-one percent of all patients with stage IIB-IV disease at presentation eventually transformed versus 14\% of those with stage I-IIA (P= .03), with transformation being especially common in patients with tumors (T3), 46\% of whom transformed. Combining elevated β2 microglobulin and lactic dehydrogenase (neither elevated v one or both elevated) was also predictive for transformation (P = .009). The median survival from initial diagnosis of MF/SS for the transformed patients was 37 months versus 163 months for the untransformed group (P = .0029). The median survival from transformation was 19.4 months (range, 2+ to 138 months). The following characteristics were associated with an inferior survival in transformed patients: (1) early transformation ({$<$}2 years from the diagnosis v ≥2 years; P = .011) and (2) advanced stage (IIB-IV v I-IIA; 2-year survival, 23\% v 86\%;P = .0035). We conclude that MF/SS patients with stages IIB-IV disease and, in particular, those with tumors have a high incidence of large-cell transformation. Patients with transformation have a relatively poor survival, especially if transformation occurs early (within 2 years) in the course of disease or if they are staged as IIB or higher. © 1998 by The American Society of Hematology.},

To determine the mutational spectrum associated with relapse, we sequenced the primary tumour and relapse genomes from eight AML patients, and validated hundreds of somatic mutations using deep sequencing; this allowed us to define clonality and clonal evolution patterns precisely at relapse. In addition to discovering novel, recurrently mutated genes (for example, WAC, SMC3, DIS3, DDX41 and DAXX) in AML, we also found two major clonal evolution patterns during AML relapse: (1) the founding clone in the primary tumour gained mutations and evolved into the relapse clone, or (2) a subclone of the founding clone survived initial therapy, gained additional mutations and expanded at relapse. In all cases, chemotherapy failed to eradicate the founding clone. The comparison of relapse-specific versus primary tumour mutations in all eight cases revealed an increase in transversions, probably due to DNA damage caused by cytotoxic chemotherapy. These data demonstrate that AML relapse is associated with the addition of new mutations and clonal evolution, which is shaped, in part, by the chemotherapy that the patients receive to establish and maintain remissions.},

  abstract = {After undergoing Ig somatic hypermutation and Ag selection, germinal center (GC) B cells terminally differentiate into either memory or plasma cells (PCs). It is known that the CD40L and IL-21/STAT3 signaling pathways play critical roles in this process, yet it is unclear how the B cell transcription program interprets and integrates these two types of T cell–derived signals. In this study, we characterized the role of STAT3 in the GC-associated PC differentiation using purified human tonsillar GC B cells and a GC B cell-like cell line. When primary GC B cells were cultured under PC differentiation condition, STAT3 inhibition by AG490 prevented the transition from GC centrocytes to preplasmablast, suggesting that STAT3 is required for the initiation of PC development. In a GC B cell-like human B cell line, although IL-21 alone can induce low-level Blimp-1 expression, maximum Blimp-1 upregulation and optimal PC differentiation required both IL-21 and CD40L. CD40L, although having no effect on Blimp-1 as a single agent, greatly augmented the amplitude and duration of IL-21–triggered Jak-STAT3 signaling. In the human PRDM1 locus, CD40L treatment enhanced the ability of STAT3 to upregulate Blimp-1 by removing BCL6, a potent inhibitor of Blimp-1 expression, from a shared BCL6/STAT3 site in intron 3. Thus, IL-21 and CD40L collaborate through at least two distinct mechanisms to synergistically promote Blimp-1 activation and PC differentiation.},

Genome-wide analysis of pair-wise chromatin interactions using chromatin conformation capture (3C)-based techniques has shed new light on the organization of chromosomes in interphase nuclei. Particularly, the finding of cell-type invariant, evolutionarily conserved topologically associating domains (TADs) in a broad spectrum of cell types has provided a new molecular framework for the study of animal development and human diseases.

By simply altering the sequence of the single-guide RNA (sgRNA), one can reprogram Cas9 to target different sites in the genome with relative ease, but the on-target activity and off-target effects of individual sgRNAs can vary widely. Here, we use recently devised sgRNA design rules to create human and mouse genome-wide libraries, perform positive and negative selection screens and observe that the use of these rules produced improved results. Additionally, we profile the off-target activity of thousands of sgRNAs and develop a metric to predict off-target sites. We incorporate these findings from large-scale, empirical data to improve our computational design rules and create optimized sgRNA libraries that maximize on-target activity and minimize off-target effects to enable more effective and efficient genetic screens and genome engineering.},

  abstract = {The current study investigated transcriptional distortion in prostate cancer cells using the vitamin D receptor (VDR) as a tool to examine how epigenetic events driven by corepressor binding and CpG methylation lead to aberrant gene expression. These relationships were investigated in the non-malignant RWPE-1 cells that were 1α,25(OH)2D3 responsive (RWPE-1) and malignant cell lines that were 1α,25(OH)2D3 partially responsive (RWPE-2) and resistant (PC-3). These studies revealed that selective attenuation and repression of VDR transcriptional responses in the cancer cell lines reflected their loss of antiproliferative sensitivity. This was evident in VDR target genes including VDR, CDKN1A (encodes p21(waf1/cip1)) and GADD45A; NCOR1 knockdown alleviated this malignant transrepression. ChIP assays in RWPE-1 and PC-3 cells revealed that transrepression of CDKN1A was associated with increased NCOR1 enrichment in response to 1α,25(OH)2D3 treatment. These findings supported the concept that retained and increased NCOR1 binding, associated with loss of H3K9ac and increased H3K9me2, may act as a beacon for the initiation and recruitment of DNA methylation. Overexpressed histone methyltransferases (KMTs) were detectable in a wide panel of prostate cancer cell lines compared with RWPE-1 and suggested that generation of H3K9me2 states would be favored. Cotreatment of cells with the KMT inhibitor, chaetocin, increased 1α,25(OH)2D3-mediated induction of CDKN1A expression supporting a role for this event to disrupt CDKN1A regulation. Parallel surveys in PC-3 cells of CpG methylation around the VDR binding regions on CDKN1A revealed altered basal and VDR-regulated DNA methylation patterns that overlapped with VDR-induced recruitment of NCOR1 and gene transrepression. Taken together, these findings suggest that sustained corepressor interactions with nuclear-resident transcription factors may inappropriately transform transient-repressive histone states into more stable and repressive DNA methylation events.},

  abstract = {Identifying large expansions of short tandem repeats (STRs), such as those that cause amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and fragile X syndrome, is challenging for short-read whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data. A solution to this problem is an important step toward integrating WGS into precision medicine. We developed a software tool called ExpansionHunter that, using PCR-free WGS short-read data, can genotype repeats at the locus of interest, even if the expanded repeat is larger than the read length. We applied our algorithm to WGS data from 3001 ALS patients who have been tested for the presence of the C9orf72 repeat expansion with repeat-primed PCR (RP-PCR). Compared against this truth data, ExpansionHunter correctly classified all (212/212, 95\% CI [0.98, 1.00]) of the expanded samples as either expansions (208) or potential expansions (4). Additionally, 99.9\% (2786/2789, 95\% CI [0.997, 1.00]) of the wild-type samples were correctly classified as wild type by this method with the remaining three samples identified as possible expansions. We further applied our algorithm to a set of 152 samples in which every sample had one of eight different pathogenic repeat expansions, including those associated with fragile X syndrome, Friedreich's ataxia, and Huntington's disease, and correctly flagged all but one of the known repeat expansions.

  abstract = {Diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCLs) are aggressive tumors derived from germinal center B cells (GC) B cells. Previous work from our group established that inferior outcome in DLBCL is associated with higher degrees of intra-tumor and inter-tumor cytosine methylation heterogeneity, although the molecules driving this epigenetic perturbation are unknown. We investigated the contribution of activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AICDA) to cytosine methylation heterogeneity in DLBCLs. AICDA is highly expressed in GC B cells where it drives somatic hypermutation (SHM) of immunoglobulin (Ig) and non-Ig genes. AICDA is also expressed in DLBCLs and high level of AICDA in CHOP-treated DLBCL patients is associated with unfavorable prognosis. In addition to mutagenesis, AICDA can cause DNA demethylation through the removal of modified cytosine residues. Indeed, we previously reported that GC B cells manifest a marked AICDA-mediated DNA hypomethylation signature as well as a high degree of epigenetic heterogeneity as compared to other B-cell subsets. Thus, we hypothesized that AICDA could contribute to the progression of GC-derived lymphomas by facilitating epigenetic plasticity through the redistribution of cytosine methylation. We overexpressed AICDA in VavP-Bcl2 transgenic mice -which develop B cell lymphomas of GC origin- using an AICDA-expressing retroviral vector (VavP-Bcl2+Aicda) vs empty vector (VavP-Bcl2) as control and transplanted them into lethally irradiated recipient mice. We observed more aggressive lymphomas based on greater disruption of the splenic architecture and higher degree of B cell infiltration in organs such as lung, liver and kidney in VavP-Bcl2+Aicda mice (n=7) compared to VavP-Bcl2 mice (n=6). Notably, the overexpression of AICDA reduced significantly the lifespan of the mice (Log-rank test p=0.0289) with a median survival of 214 days for VavP-Bcl2+Aicda mice (n=10) and 293 days for VavP-Bcl2 animals (n=9). Neoplastic B cells from VavP-Bcl2+Aicda and VavP-Bcl2 micedisplayed similar SHM rate in Ig genes (JH4 and Sm) and AICDA off-targets (Bcl6, Cd83 and Pax5), suggesting that the more aggressive phenotype is not likely due to increased mutagenesis. We then profiled the DNA methylation landscape of these lymphomas using enhanced reduced representation bisulfite sequencing. We analyzed the DNA methylation level and heterogeneity of all represented CpGs by calculating the mean methylation difference and interquartile range (IQR) between VavP-Bcl2+Aicda and VavP-Bcl2 tumors. A principal component analysis of all CpGs, each one represented by its mean methylation and IQR differences across replicates, revealed methylation loss and increased intertumor heterogeneity within VavP-Bcl2+Aicda methylomes compared to VavP-Bcl2. AICDA-perturbed CpGs (n=49,750) in particular showed significant intratumor heterogeneity (p{$<$}1e-300) in AICDA overexpressing tumors. These altered CpGs were depleted in promoters and enriched in introns and intergenic regions. We observed a remarkably similar pattern of hypomethylation and increased methylation heterogeneity in Aicda+/+ GC B cells compared to Aicda-/- GC B cells (AICDA-perturbed CpGs n=64,323) and also in primary DLBCLs with high AID compared to low AID expression (AICDA-perturbed CpGs n=37,557), suggesting a conserved epigenetic function of AICDA in GC B cells and human and mouse GC-derived lymphomas. We performed RNA sequencing on BCL2-driven lymphomas and found that expressed genes containing AICDA-perturbed CpGs displayed significantly lower expression in VavP-Bcl2+Aicda compared to VavP-Bcl2 tumors (gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) NES=-1.68, FDR{$<$}0.001). Pathway analysis revealed that these AICDA-epigenetic target genes were associated with MAPK- and KMT2D-signaling pathways, which are related to B cell activation and lymphomagenesis. Similarly to mouse tumors, genes enriched for AICDA-perturbed CpG in human lymphomas exhibited lower expression in AID high DLBCLs compared to AICDA low DLBCLs (GSEA NES=-1.65, FDR{$<$}0.001) and were associated with MAPK and KMT2D pathways. These results demonstrate that AICDA acts as a methylome modifier in GC-derived lymphomas, introducing epigenetic plasticity and leading to gene expression changes, thus contributing to clonal evolution and higher adaptability to an evolving environment.

Activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) has been recently implicated in DNA demethylation through its deaminase activity coupled with DNA repair. We investigated the epigenetic function of AID in~vivo in germinal center B cells (GCBs) isolated from wild-type (WT) and AID-deficient (Aicda−/−) mice. We determined that the transit of B cells through the GC is associated with marked locus-specific loss of methylation and increased methylation diversity, both of which are lost in Aicda−/− animals. Differentially methylated cytosines (DMCs) between GCBs and naive B cells (NBs) are enriched in genes that are targeted for somatic hypermutation (SHM) by AID, and these genes form networks required for B~cell development and proliferation. Finally, we observed significant conservation of AID-dependent epigenetic reprogramming between mouse and human B cells.},

  abstract = {Purpose of review~There is mounting evidence that heterogeneity of the epigenome is a feature of many cancers, including B-cell lymphomas, and presents important clinical implications. The purpose of this review is to explain the biological and clinical relevance of this epigenetic phenomenon in B-cell neoplasms.         Recent findings~Here, we summarize new findings demonstrating that B-cell lymphomas display increased DNA methylation heterogeneity compared to their normal counterparts. This plasticity of cytosine methylation manifests both as intertumor and intratumor heterogeneity and is associated with worse prognosis and poor clinical outcome in lymphoma patients. Recent studies of different subtypes of B-cell lymphomas have revealed that epigenetic aberrations and heterogeneous cytosine methylation patterning are common features of all neoplasms derived from B-lymphocytes, irrespective of maturation stage. With regard to mechanisms driving this process, recent reports suggest that cytosine methylation heterogeneity arises through passive and active processes. One factor implicated in active generation of cytosine methylation heterogeneity is activation-induced cytidine deaminase, which mediates DNA methylation changes and introduces epigenetic heterogeneity in normal germinal center B cells, the cells of origin of mature B-cell neoplasms such as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma.         Summary~Understanding the scope and mechanism of epigenetic heterogeneity in cancer is of paramount importance to our understanding of clonal plasticity and treatment responses in B-cell lymphomas.},

  abstract = {Primary cultured hepatocytes are a valuable in vitro model for drug metabolism studies. However, their widespread use is greatly hindered by the scarcity of suitable human liver samples. Moreover, the well-known in vitro phenotypic instability of hepatocytes, the irregular availability of fresh human liver for cell harvesting purposes, and the high batch-to-batch functional variability of hepatocyte preparations obtained from different human liver donors, seriously complicate their use in routine testing. To overcome these limitations, different cell line models have been proposed for drug metabolism screening. Human liver-derived cell lines would be ideal models for this purpose given their availability, unlimited life-span, stable phenotype, and the fact that they are easy to handle. However, the human hepatoma cells currently used (i.e. HepG2, Mz-Hep-1) show negligible levels of drug-metabolizing and do not constitute a real alternative to primary hepatocytes. Different strategies have been proposed to generate metabolically competent immortalized hepatocytes (transformation of human hepatocytes with plasmids encoding immortalizing genes, hepatocyte-like cells derived from stem cells, cell lines generated from transgenic animals, hepatocyte/hepatoma hydrid cells). Moreover, recombinant models heterologously expressing P450 enzymes in different host cells have been developed and successfully used in drug metabolism testing. In addition, new strategies have recently been explored to upregulate the expression of drug-metabolizing enzymes in cell lines of a human origin (i.e. transfection with expression vectors encoding key hepatic transcription factors). Among metabolic-based drug-drug interactions, P450 inhibition seems to be the most important. A major application of recombinant models expressing a single P450 is the screening of potential enzyme inhibitors. Therefore, pharmaceutical companies increasingly make use of cell lines to speed up the selection of new drugs with favourable pharmacokinetic and metabolic properties.},

  abstract = {Despite the established role of the transcription factor MYC in cancer, little is known about the impact of a new class of transcriptional regulators, the long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), on MYC ability to influence the cellular transcriptome. Here, we have intersected RNA-sequencing data from two MYC-inducible cell lines and a cohort of 91 B-cell lymphomas with or without genetic variants resulting in MYC overexpression. We identified 13 lncRNAs differentially expressed in IG-MYC-positive Burkitt lymphoma and regulated in the same direction by MYC in the model cell lines. Among them, we focused on a lncRNA that we named MYC-induced long noncoding RNA (MINCR), showing a strong correlation with MYC expression in MYC-positive lymphomas. To understand its cellular role, we performed RNAi and found that MINCR knockdown is associated with an impairment in cell cycle progression. Differential gene expression analysis after RNAi showed a significant enrichment of cell cycle genes among the genes down-regulated after MINCR knockdown. Interestingly, these genes are enriched in MYC binding sites in their promoters, suggesting that MINCR acts as a modulator of the MYC transcriptional program. Accordingly, MINCR knockdown was associated with a reduction in MYC binding to the promoters of selected cell cycle genes. Finally, we show that down-regulation of Aurora kinases A and B and chromatin licensing and DNA replication factor 1 may explain the reduction in cellular proliferation observed on MINCR knockdown. We, therefore, suggest that MINCR is a newly identified player in the MYC transcriptional network able to control the expression of cell cycle genes.},

HCoDES defines structures of physiologic DSBs generated by the RAG endonuclease, as well as those generated by nucleases widely used for genome editing. Analysis of G1 phase cells deficient in H2AX or 53BP1 reveals DNA ends that are frequently resected to form long single-stranded overhangs that can be repaired by mutagenic pathways. In addition to 3' overhangs, many of these DNA ends unexpectedly form long 5' single-stranded overhangs. The divergence in DNA end structures resolved by HCoDES suggests that H2AX and 53BP1 may have distinct activities in end protection. Thus, the high-resolution end structures obtained by HCoDES identify features of DNA end processing during DSB repair.},

We applied 5C to analyze a 400-kb region containing the human β-globin locus and a 100-kb conserved gene desert region. We validated 5C by detection of several previously identified looping interactions in the β-globin locus. We also identified a new looping interaction in K562 cells between the β-globin Locus Control Region and the γ–β-globin intergenic region. Interestingly, this region has been implicated in the control of developmental globin gene switching. 5C should be widely applicable for large-scale mapping of cis- and trans- interaction networks of genomic elements and for the study of higher-order chromosome structure.},

However, the relative contribution of the two main human DC subsets, myeloid (MDCs) and plasmacytoid (PDCs), in supporting B cell responses to TLR ligands remains poorly understood. We found that PDCs but not MDCs markedly enhanced B cell proliferation in response to TLR7/8-L, an imidazoquinoline derivative, and to a lesser extent to TLR9 ligands (CpG ODN classes A, B, and C). PDCs strongly enhanced TLR7/8-L-induced proliferation of both memory and naive B cells but were only able to support memory cells to differentiate to CD27high plasmablasts. In response to TLR7/8 stimulation, PDCs mediated the up-regulation of transcription factors B lymphocyte-induced maturation protein 1 and X-box binding protein 1 and enhanced differentiation of B cells into IgM-, IgG-, and IgA-producing cells. Type I IFN produced to high levels by PDCs was the principal mediator of the effects on TLR7/8 stimulation. Although MDCs expressed higher levels of the known B cell growth factors IL-6, IL-10, and B cell-activating factor in response to TLR7/8 stimulation, they were unable to enhance B cell responses in this system. These data help decipher the different roles of PDCs and MDCs for modulating human B cell responses and can contribute to selection of specific TLR ligands as vaccine adjuvants.},

To represent adequate model systems it is of utmost importance that cell lines faithfully model the primary tumor material and are not cross-contaminated with unrelated cell material (or contaminated with mycoplasma). As it has been previously reported that cross-contaminated cell lines represent a significant problem, it is of interest to know whether any improvement in the prevalence of such "false cell lines" had occurred since we called the alert in 1999. A retrospective review of our data archives covered 848 cell lines received from 1990 to 2014 from 290 laboratories in 23 countries spanning the spectrum of leukemia-lymphoma entities. Two variables were considered: authenticity and freedom from mycoplasma infection. Regarding provenance, we separately considered primary sources (original investigators having established the cell lines or reference repositories) and secondary sources. The percentages of mycoplasma-contaminated cell lines decreased significantly over the 25-year timespan. Among primary sourced material: mycoplasma-contamination fell from 23\% to 0\%; among secondary sourced: from 48\% to 21\%. The corresponding figures for cross-contamination declined from 15\% to 6\%, while among material obtained from secondary sources prevalence remained remarkably high, throughout the time periods at 14-18\%. Taken together, our data indicate that using non-authenticated cell lines from secondary sources carries a risk of about 1:6 for obtaining a false cell line. The use of authentic leukemia-lymphoma cell lines holds important translational value for their model character and the reproducibility of the laboratory data in the clinical arena.},

  abstract = {In intestinal secretions, secretory IgA (SIgA) plays an important sentinel and protective role in the recognition and clearance of enteric pathogens. In addition to serving as a first line of defense, SIgA and SIgA·antigen immune complexes are selectively transported across Peyer's patches to underlying dendritic cells in the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue, contributing to immune surveillance and immunomodulation. To explain the unexpected transport of immune complexes in face of the large excess of free SIgA in secretions, we postulated that SIgA experiences structural modifications upon antigen binding. To address this issue, we associated specific polymeric IgA and SIgA with antigens of various sizes and complexity (protein toxin, virus, bacterium). Compared with free antibody, we found modified sensitivity of the three antigens assayed after exposure to proteases from intestinal washes. Antigen binding further impacted on the immunoreactivity toward polyclonal antisera specific for the heavy and light chains of the antibody, as a function of the antigen size. These conformational changes promoted binding of the SIgA-based immune complex compared with the free antibody to cellular receptors (FcαRI and polymeric immunoglobulin receptor) expressed on the surface of premyelocytic and epithelial cell lines. These data reveal that antigen recognition by SIgA triggers structural changes that confer to the antibody enhanced receptor binding properties. This identifies immune complexes as particular structural entities integrating the presence of bound antigens and adds to the known function of immune exclusion and mucus anchoring by SIgA.},

  abstract = {AHNAK/Desmoyokin is a giant protein which has been recently linked to reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, cellular migration and invasion. Here, we investigated the role of AHNAK in the pathophysiology of larynx carcinoma-one of the major subtypes of head and neck cancer. To this end, we analysed AHNAK expression in tumor tissues from 83 larynx carcinoma patients in relation to overall survival. We found that tumoral AHNAK overexpression significantly associated with poor survival of these patients both in univariate and multivariate analysis. In further studies, we combined the prognostic value of AHNAK with selected markers of inflammation, such as macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) and tumor-infiltrating neutrophils (CD66b-positive cells). Both MIF and neutrophils have been linked to enhanced tumoral migration and poor clinical outcome in patients with orohypopharynx carcinoma-another major subtype of head and neck cancer. Interestingly, we found that synchronous high levels of AHNAK and MIF or AHNAK and neutrophils, respectively, were stronger predictors of poor survival than AHNAK alone. Synchronous high levels of all three markers were the strongest predictors of poor survival in our patient cohort. Taken together, our findings propose novel strategies for an accurate prognosis in larynx carcinoma and suggest potential mechanisms of inflammation-mediated tumor progression.},

Recent studies have highlighted the shared biology of these two entities and identified novel critical pathways of lymphomagenesis, including the presence of distinct mutations. Mediastinal grey zone lymphomas with features in between PMBCL and nodular sclerosing Hodgkin lymphoma have been described as the missing link between the two parent entities. While the standard therapeutic approach to PMBCL has been immunochemotherapy followed by mediastinal radiation, strategies that obviate the need for radiation and thus eliminate its long-term toxicities have recently been developed. The identification of novel targets in PMBCL and mediastinal grey zone lymphomas have paved the way for testing of agents such as small molecule inhibitors of Janus kinase pathways and immune checkpoint inhibitors. Future directions in these diseases should focus on combining effective novel agents with immunochemotherapy platforms.},

This can be accomplished by obtaining a more complete description of the genes that contribute to cancer. We previously described an approach using the Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposon system to model hematopoietic malignancies in mice. Here, we describe modifications of the SB system that provide additional flexibility in generating mouse models of cancer. First, we describe a Cre-inducible SBase allele, RosaSBaseLsL, that allows the restriction of transposon mutagenesis to a specific tissue of interest. This allele was used to generate a model of germinal center B-cell lymphoma by activating SBase expression with an Aid-Cre allele. In a second approach, a novel transposon was generated, T2/Onc3, in which the CMV enhancer/chicken β-actin promoter drives oncogene expression. When combined with ubiquitous SBase expression, the T2/Onc3 transposon produced nearly 200 independent tumors of more than 20 different types in a cohort of 62 mice. Analysis of transposon insertion sites identified novel candidate genes, including Zmiz1 and Rian, involved in squamous cell carcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma, respectively. These novel alleles provide additional tools for the SB system and provide some insight into how this mutagenesis system can be manipulated to model cancer in mice. [Cancer Res 2009;69(20):8150–6]},

Deletions in the H4 N-terminus reduce GAL1 activation 20-fold. This effect is specific to histone H4 in that large deletions in the N-termini of H2A, H2B, and H3 do not similarly decrease induction. Activation of the PHO5 promoter is reduced approximately 4- to 5-fold by these H4 deletions. Mutations in histone H4 acetylation sites and surrounding residues can cause comparable and, in some cases, even greater effects on induction of these two promoters. We postulate that the H4 N-terminus may interact with a component of the transcription initiation complex, allowing nucleosome unfolding and subsequent initiation.},

What are the properties of human proteins that interact with pathogens? Do pathogens interact with certain functional classes of human proteins? Which infection mechanisms and pathways are commonly triggered by multiple pathogens? In this paper, to our knowledge, we provide the first study of the landscape of human proteins interacting with pathogens. We integrate human-pathogen protein-protein interactions (PPIs) for 190 pathogen strains from seven public databases. Nearly all of the 10,477 human-pathogen PPIs are for viral systems (98.3\%), with the majority belonging to the human-HIV system (77.9\%). We find that both viral and bacterial pathogens tend to interact with hubs (proteins with many interacting partners) and bottlenecks (proteins that are central to many paths in the network) in the human PPI network. We construct separate sets of human proteins interacting with bacterial pathogens, viral pathogens, and those interacting with multiple bacteria and with multiple viruses. Gene Ontology functions enriched in these sets reveal a number of processes, such as cell cycle regulation, nuclear transport, and immune response that participate in interactions with different pathogens. Our results provide the first global view of strategies used by pathogens to subvert human cellular processes and infect human cells.

  abstract = {Author Summary{$<$}p{$>$}Many pathogens, such as viruses and bacteria, cause disease in humans. Pathogen infections result in illness and death for millions of people each year. Pathogens communicate with human cells through physical interactions with various human proteins on the surface of the cell and within the interior of the cell. These interactions allow the pathogen to enter the host cell, manipulate important cellular processes, multiply, and invade other cells. In this paper, we compare interactions between human and pathogen proteins from 190 different pathogens to provide important insights into strategies used by pathogens to infect human cells. We show that both viral and bacterial proteins interact with human proteins that themselves interact with many human proteins or with human proteins that lie on many communication channels between other human proteins. Pathogens may have evolved to interact with these human proteins since they may control critical human cellular process. We also demonstrate that many viruses share common infection strategies, e.g., lengthening particular stages of the cell cycle, controlling programmed cell death, and interacting with the nuclear membrane to transfer viral genetic material into and out of the nucleus. Such studies may help us better understand the process of infection and identify better strategies to prevent or cure infection.{$<$}/p{$><$}/sec{$>$}},

  abstract = {Transcriptional initiation of each gene is assumed to be independently controlled in mammals. On the other hand, recent large-scale transcriptome analyses have shown that the genome is pervasively transcribed, such that the most of its DNA gives rise to RNAs. This raises the question of whether it is possible to pinpoint and activate a particular locus without perturbing numerous neighbouring transcripts. Here we show that intensive transcription at one locus frequently spills over into its physical neighbouring loci. Rapid induction of immediate-early genes (IEGs) in response to growth factor stimulation is accompanied by co-upregulation of their neighbouring genes. Profiling the primary transcripts in the nucleus with whole-genome tiling arrays delineated simultaneous activation of transcription centred on IEGs. Even in surrounding intergenic regions, transcriptional activation took place at the same time. Acetylation levels of histone H3 and H4 are elevated along with the IEG induction and neighbouring co-upregulation. Inhibition of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway or the transcription factor SRF suppresses all transcriptional upregulation. These results suggest that transcriptional activation has a ripple effect, which may be advantageous for coordinated expression.},

Although we noted a trend for increasing genomic complexity in initial versus late FL samples, the overall frequencies of CNAs in initial and late FL biopsies showed a surprisingly stable pattern through the course of the disease. In 27 of cases the initial samples harbored CNAs that were absent in relapse samples, indicating that tumor cell clones at relapse were not direct descendants of initially dominating clones.

By using a sensitive and quantitative assay, we find that clinical isolates of several types of B cell lymphomas, including diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), have 10- to 30-fold higher copy numbers of miR-155 than do normal circulating B cells. Similarly, the quantities of BIC RNA are elevated in lymphoma cells, but ratios of the amounts of the two RNAs are not constant, suggesting that the level of miR-155 is controlled by transcription and processing. Significantly higher levels of miR-155 are present in DLBCLs with an activated B cell phenotype than with the germinal center phenotype.

  abstract = {Patient derived xenografts (PDXs) have become a vital, frequently used, component of anti-cancer drug development. PDXs can be serially passaged in vivo for years, and shared across laboratories. As a consequence, the potential for mis-identification and cross-contamination is possible, yet authentication of PDXs appears limited. We present a PDX Authentication System (PAS), by combining a commercially available OpenArray assay of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with in-house R studio programs, to validate PDXs established in individual mice from acute lymphoblastic leukemia biopsies. The PAS is sufficiently robust to identify contamination at levels as low as 3\%, similar to the gold standard of short tandem repeat (STR) profiling. We have surveyed a panel of PDXs established from 73 individual leukemia patients, and found that the PAS provided sufficient discriminatory power to identify each xenograft. The identified SNP-discrepant PDXs demonstrated distinct gene expression profiles, indicating a risk of contamination for PDXs at high passage number. The PAS also allows for the authentication of tumor cells with complex karyotypes from solid tumors including prostate cancer and Ewing's sarcoma. This study highlights the demands of authenticating PDXs for cancer research, and evaluates a reliable authentication platform that utilizes a commercially available and cost-effective system.},

  abstract = {Posttranslational modifications to histones affect chromatin structure and function resulting in altered gene expression and changes in cell behavior. Aberrant gene expression and altered epigenomic patterns are major features of cancer. Epigenetic changes including histone acetylation, histone methylation, and DNA methylation are now thought to play important roles in the onset and progression of cancer in numerous tumor types. Indeed dysregulated epigenetic modifications, especially in early neoplastic development, may be just as significant as genetic mutations in driving cancer development and growth. The reversal of aberrant epigenetic changes has therefore emerged as a potential strategy for the treatment of cancer. A number of compounds targeting enzymes that regulate histone acetylation, histone methylation, and DNA methylation have been developed as epigenetic therapies, with some demonstrating efficacy in hematological malignancies and solid tumors. This review highlights the roles of epigenetic modifications to histones and DNA in tumorigenesis and emerging epigenetic therapies being developed for the treatment of cancer.

  abstract = {Mammalian genomes are pervasively transcribed to produce thousands of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). A few of these lncRNAs have been shown to recruit regulatory complexes through RNA–protein interactions to influence the expression of nearby genes, and it has been suggested that many other lncRNAs can also act as local regulators. Such local functions could explain the observation that lncRNA expression is often correlated with the expression of nearby genes. However, these correlations have been challenging to dissect and could alternatively result from processes that are not mediated by the lncRNA transcripts themselves. For example, some gene promoters have been proposed to have dual functions as enhancers, and the process of transcription itself may contribute to gene regulation by recruiting activating factors or remodelling nucleosomes. Here we use genetic manipulation in mouse cell lines to dissect 12 genomic loci that produce lncRNAs and find that 5 of these loci influence the expression of a neighbouring gene in cis. Notably, none of these effects requires the specific lncRNA transcripts themselves and instead involves general processes associated with their production, including enhancer-like activity of gene promoters, the process of transcription, and the splicing of the transcript. Furthermore, such effects are not limited to lncRNA loci: we find that four out of six protein-coding loci also influence the expression of a neighbour. These results demonstrate that cross-talk among neighbouring genes is a prevalent phenomenon that can involve multiple mechanisms and cis-regulatory signals, including a role for RNA splice sites. These mechanisms may explain the function and evolution of some genomic loci that produce lncRNAs and broadly contribute to the regulation of both coding and non-coding genes.},

However, we are only beginning to understand the nature and extent of the involvement of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) in disease. Other ncRNAs, such as PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), transcribed ultraconserved regions (T-UCRs) and large intergenic non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs) are emerging as key elements of cellular homeostasis. Along with microRNAs, dysregulation of these ncRNAs is being found to have relevance not only to tumorigenesis, but also to neurological, cardiovascular, developmental and other diseases. There is great interest in therapeutic strategies to counteract these perturbations of ncRNAs.},

  abstract = {Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma is a heterogeneous group of lymphomas characterized by the accumulation of malignant T cells in the skin. The molecular and cellular etiology of this malignancy remains enigmatic, and what role antigenic stimulation plays in the initiation and/or progression of the disease remains to be elucidated. Deep sequencing of the tumor genome showed a highly heterogeneous landscape of genetic perturbations, and transcriptome analysis of transformed T cells further highlighted the heterogeneity of this disease. Nonetheless, using data harvested from high-throughput transcriptional profiling allowed us to develop a reliable signature of this malignancy. Focusing on a key cytokine signaling pathway previously implicated in cutaneous T-cell lymphoma pathogenesis, JAK/STAT signaling, we used conditional gene targeting to develop a fully penetrant small animal model of this disease that recapitulates many key features of mycosis fungoides, a common variant of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Using this mouse model, we show that T-cell receptor engagement is critical for malignant transformation of the T lymphocytes and that progression of the disease is dependent on microbiota.},

  abstract = {Vorinostat is a histone deacetylase inhibitor that induces differentiation, growth arrest, and/or apoptosis of malignant cells both in vitro and in vivo and has shown clinical responses in ∼30\% of patients with advanced mycosis fungoides and Sézary syndrome cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL). The purpose of this study was to identify biomarkers predictive of vorinostat response in CTCL using preclinical model systems and to assess these biomarkers in clinical samples. The signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) signaling pathway was evaluated. The data indicate that persistent activation of STAT1, STAT3, and STAT5 correlate with resistance to vorinostat in lymphoma cell lines. Simultaneous treatment with a pan-Janus-activated kinase inhibitor resulted in synergistic antiproliferative effect and down-regulation of the expression of several antiapoptotic genes. Immunohistochemical analysis of STAT1 and phosphorylated tyrosine STAT3 (pSTAT3) in skin biopsies obtained from CTCL patients enrolled in the vorinostat phase IIb trial showed that nuclear accumulation of STAT1 and high levels of nuclear pSTAT3 in malignant T cells correlate with a lack of clinical response. These results suggest that deregulation of STAT activity plays a role in vorinostat resistance in CTCL, and strategies that block this pathway may improve vorinostat response. Furthermore, these findings may be of prognostic value in predicting the response of CTCL patients to vorinostat. [Cancer Res 2008;68(10):3785–94]},

Thus, it is important to keep MYC activity in check in normal cells in order to avoid unwanted oncogenic changes. Normal cells have adapted several ways to control MYC levels, and these mechanisms can be disrupted in cancer cells. One of the major ways in which MYC levels are controlled in cells is through targeted degradation by the ubiquitin–proteasome system (UPS). Here, we discuss the role of the UPS in the regulation of MYC protein levels and review some of the many proteins that have been shown to regulate MYC protein stability. In addition, we discuss how this relates to MYC transcriptional activity, human cancers, and therapeutic targeting.},

Genome-wide measurement technologies provide new means to understand this regulation, and models of TF regulatory networks have been built with the goal of identifying critical factors. Here, we report a network model of transcriptional regulation between TFs constructed by integrating genomewide identification of active enhancers and regions of focal DNA accessibility. Network topology is confirmed by published TF ChIP-seq data. By considering multiple methods of TF prioritization following network construction, we identify master TFs in well-studied cell types, and these networks provide better prioritization than networks only considering promoter-proximal accessibility peaks. Comparisons between networks from similar cell types show stable connectivity of most TFs, while master regulator TFs show dramatic changes in connectivity and centrality. Applying this method to study chronic lymphocytic leukemia, we prioritized several network TFs amenable to pharmacological perturbation and show that compounds targeting these TFs show comparable efficacy in CLL cell lines to FDA-approved therapies. The construction of transcriptional regulatory network (TRN) models can predict the interactions between individual TFs and predict critical TFs for development or disease.},

  abstract = {Embryonic stem (ES) cells are under precise control of both intrinsic self-renewal gene regulatory network and extrinsic growth factor-triggered signaling cascades. How external signaling pathways connect to core self-renewal transcriptional circuits is largely unknown. To probe this, we chose BMP signaling, which is previously recognized as a master control for both self-renewal and lineage commitment of murine ES cells. Here, we mapped target gene promoter occupancy of SMAD1/5 and SMAD4 on a genome-wide scale and found that they associate with a large group of developmental regulators that are enriched for H3K27 trimethylation and H3K4 trimethylation bivalent marks and are repressed in the self-renewing state, whereas they are rapidly induced upon differentiation. Smad knockdown experiments further indicate that SMAD-mediated BMP signaling is largely required for differentiation-related processes rather than directly influencing self-renewal. Among the SMAD-associated genes, we further identified Dpysl2 (previously known as Crmp2) and the H3K27 demethylase Kdm6b (previously known as Jmjd3) as BMP4-modulated early neural differentiation regulators. Combined with computational analysis, our results suggest that SMAD-mediated BMP signaling balances self-renewal versus differentiation by modulating a set of developmental regulators.},

With the understanding that all cells of an organism carry the same DNA, and with increased knowledge of mechanisms of gene expression, the definition was changed to focus on ways in which heritable traits can be associated not with changes in nucleotide sequence, but with chemical modifications of DNA, or of the structural and regulatory proteins bound to it. Recent discoveries about the role of these mechanisms in early development may make it desirable to return to the original definition of epigenetics., “Epigenetics” originally denoted processes that allow a single fertilized egg to develop into numerous highly differentiated tissues. Many now use the term to refer just to chromatin modifications, but the original definition may be most appropriate.},

  abstract = {Epigenetic modifications of the genome are generally stable in somatic cells of multicellular organisms. In germ cells and early embryos, however, epigenetic reprogramming occurs on a genome-wide scale, which includes demethylation of DNA and remodeling of histones and their modifications. The mechanisms of genome-wide erasure of DNA methylation, which involve modifications to 5-methylcytosine and DNA repair, are being unraveled. Epigenetic reprogramming has important roles in imprinting, the natural as well as experimental acquisition of totipotency and pluripotency, control of transposons, and epigenetic inheritance across generations. Small RNAs and the inheritance of histone marks may also contribute to epigenetic inheritance and reprogramming. Reprogramming occurs in flowering plants and in mammals, and the similarities and differences illuminate developmental and reproductive strategies.},

The precise role that lncRNA expression plays in the pathogenesis of B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) is unknown. Therefore, unbiased microarray profiling was performed on human B-ALL specimens and it was determined that lncRNA expression correlates with cytogenetic abnormalities, which was confirmed by RT-qPCR in a large set of B-ALL cases. Importantly, high expression of BALR-2 correlated with poor overall survival and diminished response to prednisone treatment. In line with a function for this lncRNA in regulating cell survival, BALR-2 knockdown led to reduced proliferation, increased apoptosis, and increased sensitivity to prednisolone treatment. Conversely, overexpression of BALR-2 led to increased cell growth and resistance to prednisone treatment. Interestingly, BALR-2 expression was repressed by prednisolone treatment and its knockdown led to upregulation of the glucocorticoid response pathway in both human and mouse B-cells. Together, these findings indicate that BALR-2 plays a functional role in the pathogenesis and/or clinical responsiveness of B-ALL and that altering the levels of particular lncRNAs may provide a future direction for therapeutic development. Implications: lncRNA expression has the potential to segregate the common subtypes of B-ALL, predict the cytogenetic subtype, and indicate prognosis.},

Mutational and epigenetic profiling of a large acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patient cohort revealed that IDH1/2-mutant AMLs display global DNA hypermethylation and a specific hypermethylation signature. Furthermore, expression of 2HG-producing IDH alleles in cells induced global DNA hypermethylation. In the AML cohort, IDH1/2 mutations were mutually exclusive with mutations in the α-ketoglutarate-dependent enzyme TET2, and TET2 loss-of-function mutations were associated with similar epigenetic defects as IDH1/2 mutants. Consistent with these genetic and epigenetic data, expression of IDH mutants impaired TET2 catalytic function in cells. Finally, either expression of mutant IDH1/2 or Tet2 depletion impaired hematopoietic differentiation and increased stem/progenitor cell marker expression, suggesting a shared proleukemogenic effect.},

It binds specifically to regulatory sequences in the promoter-proximal regions of chicken, mouse, and human c-myc oncogenes. CTCF contains two transcription repressor domains transferable to a heterologous DNA binding domain. One CTCF binding site, conserved in mouse and human c-myc genes, is found immediately downstream of the major P2 promoter at a sequence which maps precisely within the region of RNA polymerase II pausing and release. Gel shift assays of nuclear extracts from mouse and human cells show that CTCF is the predominant factor binding to this sequence. Mutational analysis of the P2-proximal CTCF binding site and transient-cotransfection experiments demonstrate that CTCF is a transcriptional repressor of the human c-myc gene. Although there is 100\% sequence identity in the DNA binding domains of the avian and human CTCF proteins, the regulatory sequences recognized by CTCF in chicken and human c-myc promoters are clearly diverged. Mutating the contact nucleotides confirms that CTCF binding to the human c-myc P2 promoter requires a number of unique contact DNA bases that are absent in the chicken c-myc CTCF binding site. Moreover, proteolytic-protection assays indicate that several more CTCF Zn fingers are involved in contacting the human CTCF binding site than the chicken site. Gel shift assays utilizing successively deleted Zn finger domains indicate that CTCF Zn fingers 2 to 7 are involved in binding to the chicken c-myc promoter, while fingers 3 to 11 mediate CTCF binding to the human promoter. This flexibility in Zn finger usage reveals CTCF to be a unique "multivalent" transcriptional factor and provides the first feasible explanation of how certain homologous genes (i.e., c-myc) of different vertebrate species are regulated by the same factor and maintain similar expression patterns despite significant promoter sequence divergence.},

  abstract = {Cancer epigenetics in the driver's seat Recent cancer genome projects unexpectedly highlighted the role of epigenetic alterations in cancer development. About half of human cancers were found to harbor mutations in chromatin proteins. In a Review, Flavahan et al. propose that chromatin and epigenetic aberrations have the potential to confer on cells the full range of oncogenic properties represented in the classic “hallmarks” depiction of cancer. They suggest that genetic, environmental, and metabolic factors can make chromatin aberrantly permissive or restrictive. Permissive chromatin creates a state of “epigenetic plasticity,” which can activate oncogene expression or cell fate changes that drive cancer development. Science, this issue p. eaal2380 Structured Abstract BACKGROUNDChromatin is the essential medium through which transcription factors, signaling pathways, and other cues alter gene activity and cellular phenotypes. It assumes distinct conformations that reinforce regulatory activity or repression at a given locus, and reorganizes in response to appropriate intrinsic and extrinsic signals. The biologist Conrad Waddington famously conceptualized developmental specification as an epigenetic landscape in which differentiating cells proceed downhill along branching canals separated by walls that restrict cell identity. By restricting lineage-specific gene expression and phenotypes, chromatin affects the height of the walls between the canals in this epigenetic landscape.Genetic, metabolic, and environmental stimuli that disrupt chromatin alter cellular states and responses, thereby predisposing individuals to a range of common diseases. Although cancer is typically considered a genetic disease, chromatin and epigenetic aberrations play important roles in tumor potentiation, initiation, and progression. ADVANCESWe discuss how the stability of chromatin, or its “resistance” to change, is precisely titrated during normal development, and we propose that deviation from this norm is a major factor in tumorigenesis. We review genetic, environmental, and metabolic stimuli that disrupt the homeostatic balance of chromatin, causing it to become aberrantly restrictive or permissive. Stimuli that increase chromatin resistance may result in a restrictive state that blocks differentiation programs. Stimuli that decrease chromatin resistance may result in a permissive state, which we refer to as epigenetic plasticity. We propose that plasticity allows premalignant or malignant cells to stochastically activate alternate gene regulatory programs and/or undergo nonphysiologic cell fate transitions. Some stochastic changes will be inconsequential “passengers”; others will confer fitness and be selected as “drivers.” As cancer cells divide, acquired epigenetic states may be maintained through cell division by DNA methylation, repressive chromatin, or gene regulatory circuits, giving rise to adaptive epiclones that fuel malignant progression.We highlight specific chromatin aberrations that confer epigenetic restriction or plasticity, and ultimately drive tumor progression via oncogene activation, tumor suppressor silencing, or adaptive cell fate transitions. Aberrations initiated by defined genetic stimuli, such as chromatin regulator gene mutations, are particularly informative regarding mechanism. Examples include gain-of-function mutations of the Polycomb repressor EZH2 that promote chromatin restriction and hinder differentiation, and metabolic enzyme mutations that disrupt the balance of DNA methylation. Changes in DNA methylation resulting from the latter have been tied to tumor suppressor silencing but may also result in stochastic insulator disruption and oncogene activation. We also carefully consider metabolic and environmental stimuli that disrupt chromatin homeostasis in the absence of genetic changes. Examples include links between folate metabolism and methylase activity, environmental factors that promote DNA hypermethylation in gastrointestinal tissues, and potential effects of microenvironmental stress on chromatin regulator expression. Purely epigenetic mechanisms may explain tumors that arise with few or no recurrent mutations, as well as heterogeneous functional phenotypes within tumors that lack genetic explanation. We conclude that chromatin and epigenetic aberrations can confer wide-ranging oncogenic properties and may fulfill all of cancer’s hallmarks. OUTLOOKInitial successes with epigenetic therapies suggest the potential of cancer epigenetics for major clinical impact. Yet realizing this promise will require a clearer understanding of epigenetic mechanisms of tumorigenesis. The identification of increasing numbers of oncogenic epigenetic lesions provides an opportunity to develop and test conceptual and mechanistic models of their functions. Progress will require new technologies for probing chromatin and epigenetic alterations with single-cell precision, as well as experimental models that faithfully recapitulate epigenetic states in tumors. We are optimistic that an improved understanding of epigenetic plasticity and restriction could advance diagnostic strategies for evaluating tumor stage and heterogeneity, and yield new therapeutic strategies for correcting epigenetic lesions or exploiting vulnerabilities of epigenetically altered cells. {$<$}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="https://d2ufo47lrtsv5s.cloudfront.net/content/sci/357/6348/eaal2380/F1.medium.gif"/{$>$} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Epigenetic plasticity and the hallmarks of cancer.(Left) Normal chromatin and associated epigenetic mechanisms stabilize gene expression and cellular states while facilitating appropriate responses to developmental or environmental cues (blue nuclei represent normal cell state). Genetic, environmental, and metabolic insults that disrupt chromatin can lead to either restrictive or overly permissive chromatin states. (Center) Overly permissive chromatin results in epigenetic plasticity; this plasticity permits stochastic activation of alternate gene regulatory programs (red nuclei represent cancer-like cell state). (Right) Some stochastic changes will be inconsequential “passengers” while others will confer fitness and be selected as “drivers”; in this way, chromatin aberrations have the potential to fulfill each hallmark of cancer. Chromatin and associated epigenetic mechanisms stabilize gene expression and cellular states while also facilitating appropriate responses to developmental or environmental cues. Genetic, environmental, or metabolic insults can induce overly restrictive or overly permissive epigenetic landscapes that contribute to pathogenesis of cancer and other diseases. Restrictive chromatin states may prevent appropriate induction of tumor suppressor programs or block differentiation. By contrast, permissive or “plastic” states may allow stochastic oncogene activation or nonphysiologic cell fate transitions. Whereas many stochastic events will be inconsequential “passengers,” some will confer a fitness advantage to a cell and be selected as “drivers.” We review the broad roles played by epigenetic aberrations in tumor initiation and evolution and their potential to give rise to all classic hallmarks of cancer.},

However, identifying subpopulation-level changes in a heterogeneous sample remains challenging. Thus, we have developed a computational approach, DXM, to deconvolve the methylation profiles of major allelic subpopulations from the bisulfite sequencing data of a heterogeneous sample. DXM does not require prior knowledge of the number of subpopulations or types of cells to expect. We benchmark DXM’s performance and demonstrate improvement over existing methods. We further experimentally validate DXM predicted allelic subpopulation-methylation profiles in four Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphomas (DLBCLs). Lastly, as proof-of-concept, we apply DXM to a cohort of 31 DLBCLs and relate allelic subpopulation methylation profiles to relapse. We thus demonstrate that DXM can robustly find allelic subpopulation methylation profiles that may contribute to disease progression using bisulfite sequencing data of any heterogeneous sample.},

  abstract = {The geminivirus, tomato golden mosaic virus (TGMV), encodes one protein, AL1, that is absolutely required for viral DNA replication. AL1 interacts with the TGMV DNA genome by binding specifically to the viral origin of replication. We have investigated the nature and significance of AL1/origin interactions in vitro and in vivo by using competitive DNA binding and transient replication assays. Competition assays established that a 13-base pair (bp) element (5'-GGTAGTAAGGTAG) containing two 5-bp direct repeat motifs separated by a 3-bp central core constitutes a high affinity AL1 binding site. DNAs containing intact 3' repeat sequences plus core (TAAGGTAG and ccTAGTAAGGTAG) were stronger competitors for AL1 binding than DNAs containing intact 5' repeat sequences plus core (GGTAGTAA and GGTAGTA-AccTAG), thereby demonstrating that AL1 interacts differently with the repeat motifs. Replication in tobacco protoplasts established that the AL1 binding site is an essential cis-acting element for viral replication. No replication was detected for DNAs containing mutations in either of the repeat motifs of the AL1 recognition sequence when AL1 was provided in trans from a plant gene expression vector. In contrast, a DNA with a mutation in the 5' repeat motif (ccTAGTAAGGTAG) replicated when both AL1 and AL3, a TGMV protein involved in viral DNA accumulation, were provided in trans. No replication was detected for a DNA containing a mutation in the 3' repeat motif (GGTAGTAAccTAG) in the presence of AL1 and AL3. The in vitro and in vivo results suggest that binding of AL1 to the 3' repeat element is an essential step in DNA replication, while binding to the 5' repeat element may serve to enhance viral replication.},

Our analysis of a region extending 11 kilobases (kb) 5' of the epsilon-globin gene reveals many minor nuclease-hypersensitive sites and one major site located 6.1 kb upstream of the epsilon-globin gene. All of these hypersensitive sites are erythroid-specific, and the major site is stable throughout erythroid development. As assayed by nuclear runoff transcription, little or no epsilon-globin gene expression is detectable in fetal or adult erythroid cells. Thus, the presence of the major hypersensitive site 5' of the epsilon-globin gene in both fetal and adult erythroid cells demonstrates that this site is not specifically correlated with transcription of the gene or with a particular stage of development. Rather, this site may reflect an early event in erythroid differentiation. In addition, DNase I has been used to probe the overall sensitivity of epsilon-globin chromatin in fetal erythroid cells. Our findings indicate that the epsilon-globin gene as well as the other genes in the beta-globin cluster reside within the chromatin domain that is more DNase I-sensitive than "bulk" chromatin.},

Dysregulation of the Pit/Oct/Unc (POU) domain-containing transcription factor POU4F1 is a recurring abnormality in t(8;21) AML. In this study, we showed that POU4F1 overexpression is highly correlated with, but not caused by, AE. We observed that AE markedly increases the self-renewal capacity of myeloid progenitors from murine bone marrow or fetal liver and drives the expansion of these cells in liquid culture. POU4F1 is neither necessary nor sufficient for these AE-dependent properties, suggesting that it contributes to leukemia through novel mechanisms. To identify targets of POU4F1, we performed gene expression profiling in primary mouse cells with genetically defined levels of POU4F1 and identified 140 differentially expressed genes. This expression signature was significantly enriched in human t(8;21) AML samples and was sufficient to cluster t(8;21) AML samples in an unsupervised hierarchical analysis. Among the most highly differentially expressed genes, half are known AML1/ETO targets, implying that the unique transcriptional signature of t(8;21) AML is, in part, attributable to POU4F1 and not AML1/ETO itself. These genes provide novel candidates for understanding the biology and developing therapeutic approaches for t(8;21) AML.},

Recent reports have shown that developmental genes often possess multiple discrete enhancer modules that drive transcription in similar spatio-temporal patterns: primary enhancers located near the basal promoter and secondary, or ‘shadow’, enhancers located at more remote positions. It has been proposed that the seemingly redundant activity of primary and secondary enhancers contributes to phenotypic robustness. We tested this hypothesis by generating a deficiency that removes two newly discovered enhancers of shavenbaby (svb, a transcript of the ovo locus), a gene encoding a transcription factor that directs development of Drosophila larval trichomes. At optimal temperatures for embryonic development, this deficiency causes minor defects in trichome patterning. In embryos that develop at both low and high extreme temperatures, however, absence of these secondary enhancers leads to extensive loss of trichomes. These temperature-dependent defects can be rescued by a transgene carrying a secondary enhancer driving transcription of the svb cDNA. Finally, removal of one copy of wingless, a gene required for normal trichome patterning, causes a similar loss of trichomes only in flies lacking the secondary enhancers. These results support the hypothesis that secondary enhancers contribute to phenotypic robustness in the face of environmental and genetic variability.},

MyD88-dependent Toll-like receptor signaling is a key mediator of microbial–host cross-talk. We examined the role of epithelial MyD88 expression by generating mice with an IEC-targeted deletion of the Myd88 gene (MyD88ΔIEC). Loss of epithelial MyD88 signaling resulted in increased numbers of mucus-associated bacteria; translocation of bacteria, including the opportunistic pathogen Klebsiella pneumoniae, to mesenteric lymph nodes; reduced transmucosal electrical resistance; impaired mucus-associated antimicrobial activity; and downregulated expression of polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (the epithelial IgA transporter), mucin-2 (the major protein of intestinal mucus), and the antimicrobial peptides RegIIIγ and Defa-rs1. We further observed significant differences in the composition of the gut microbiota between MyD88ΔIEC mice and wild-type littermates. These physical, immunological, and microbial defects resulted in increased susceptibility of MyD88ΔIEC mice to experimental colitis. We conclude that MyD88 signaling in IECs is crucial for maintenance of gut homeostasis.},

  abstract = {General properties of the antagonistic biomolecular interactions between viruses and their hosts (exogenous interactions) remain poorly understood, and may differ significantly from known principles governing the cooperative interactions within the host (endogenous interactions). Systems biology approaches have been applied to study the combined interaction networks of virus and human proteins, but such efforts have so far revealed only low-resolution patterns of host-virus interaction. Here, we layer curated and predicted 3D structural models of human-virus and human-human protein complexes on top of traditional interaction networks to reconstruct the human-virus structural interaction network. This approach reveals atomic resolution, mechanistic patterns of host-virus interaction, and facilitates systematic comparison with the host’s endogenous interactions. We find that exogenous interfaces tend to overlap with and mimic endogenous interfaces, thereby competing with endogenous binding partners. The endogenous interfaces mimicked by viral proteins tend to participate in multiple endogenous interactions which are transient and regulatory in nature. While interface overlap in the endogenous network results largely from gene duplication followed by divergent evolution, viral proteins frequently achieve interface mimicry without any sequence or structural similarity to an endogenous binding partner. Finally, while endogenous interfaces tend to evolve more slowly than the rest of the protein surface, exogenous interfaces—including many sites of endogenous-exogenous overlap—tend to evolve faster, consistent with an evolutionary “arms race” between host and pathogen. These significant biophysical, functional, and evolutionary differences between host-pathogen and within-host protein-protein interactions highlight the distinct consequences of antagonism versus cooperation in biological networks.},

  abstract = {Our research in the past few years has identified B cell–specific biomarkers able to predict optimal Ab responses in both young and elderly individuals. These biomarkers are activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID), the enzyme of class switch recombination and somatic hypermutation; the transcription factor E47, crucial for AID expression; and the ability to generate optimal memory B cells. Moreover, we have found that the increased proinflammatory status of the elderly, both in sera and intrinsic to B cells, negatively impacts B cell function. We have now investigated whether particular inflammatory microRNAs (miRs) contribute to decreased E47 and AID in aged B cells. Our data indicate that E47 and AID mRNA stability is lower in stimulated B cells from elderly individuals. We measured the expression of two miRs crucial for class switch recombination, miR-155 and miR-16, in human unstimulated B cells from young and elderly individuals with the rationale that increases in these before stimulation would decrease E47/AID upon cell activation. We found these miRs and B cell–intrinsic inflammation upregulated in aged unstimulated B cells and negatively associated with AID in the same B cells after stimulation with CpG. We propose that the downregulation of AID in aged human B cells may occur through binding of miR-155 to the 3′-untranslated regions of AID mRNA and/or binding of miR-16 to the 3′-untranslated regions of E47 mRNA, as well as at the transcriptional level of less E47 for AID. Our results indicate novel molecular pathways leading to reduced B cell function with aging.},

  abstract = {The polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR) is a key component of the mucosal immune system that mediates epithelial transcytosis of immunoglobulins. High pIgR expression has been reported to correlate with a less aggressive tumour phenotype and an improved prognosis in several human cancer types. Here, we examined the expression and prognostic significance of pIgR in pancreatic and periampullary adenocarcinoma. The study cohort encompasses a consecutive series of 175 patients surgically treated with pancreaticoduodenectomy for pancreatic and periampullary adenocarcinoma in Malmö and Lund University Hospitals, Sweden, between 2001–2011. Tissue microarrays were constructed from primary tumours (n = 175) and paired lymph node metastases (n = 105). A multiplied score was calculated from the fraction and intensity of pIgR staining. Classification and regression tree analysis was used to select the prognostic cut-off. Unadjusted and adjusted hazard ratios (HR) for death and recurrence within 5 years were calculated. pIgR expression could be evaluated in 172/175 (98.3\%) primary tumours and in 96/105 (91.4\%) lymph node metastases. pIgR expression was significantly down-regulated in lymph node metastases as compared with primary tumours (p = 0.018). Low pIgR expression was significantly associated with poor differentiation grade (p{$<$}0.001), perineural growth (p = 0.027), lymphatic invasion (p = 0.016), vascular invasion (p = 0.033) and infiltration of the peripancreatic fat (p = 0.039). In the entire cohort, low pIgR expression was significantly associated with an impaired 5-year survival (HR = 2.99, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 1.71–5.25) and early recurrence (HR = 2.89, 95\% CI 1.67–4.98). This association remained significant for survival after adjustment for conventional clinicopathological factors, tumour origin and adjuvant treatment (HR = 1.98, 95\% CI 1.10–3.57). These results demonstrate, for the first time, that high tumour-specific pIgR expression signifies a more favourable tumour phenotype and that low expression independently predicts a shorter survival in patients with pancreatic and periampullary cancer. The mechanistic basis for the putative tumour suppressing properties of pIgR in these cancers merits further study.},

To comprehensively examine the effects of AID on the transcriptome and the pattern of DNA methylation ('methylome'), we analyzed AID-deficient (Aicda−/−), wild-type and AID-overexpressing activated B cells by high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) and reduced-representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS). These analyses confirmed the known role of AID in immunoglobulin isotype switching and also demonstrated few other effects of AID on gene expression. Additionally, we detected no evidence of AID-dependent editing of mRNA or microRNA. Finally, the RRBS data did not support the proposed role for AID in regulating DNA methylation. Thus, despite evidence of its additional activities in other systems, antibody diversification seems to be the sole physiological function of AID in activated B cells.},

  abstract = {Overexpression of enhancer of zeste homologue 2 (EZH2) occurs in various malignancies and is associated with a poor prognosis, especially because of increased cancer cell proliferation. In this study we found an inverse correlation between EZH2 and RUNX3 gene expression in five cancer cell lines, i.e. gastric, breast, prostate, colon, and pancreatic cancer cell lines. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay showed an association between EZH2 bound to the RUNX3 gene promoter, and trimethylated histone H3 at lysine 27, and HDAC1 (histone deacetylase 1) bound to the RUNX3 gene promoter in cancer cells. RNA interference-mediated knockdown of EZH2 resulted in a decrease in H3K27 trimethylation and unbound HDAC1 and an increase in expression of the RUNX3 gene. Restoration of RUNX3 expression was not associated with any change in DNA methylation status in the RUNX3 promoter region. RUNX3 was repressed by histone deacetylation and hypermethylation of a CpG island in the promoter region and restored by trichostatin A or/and 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine. Immunofluorescence staining confirmed restoration of expression of the RUNX3 protein after knockdown of EZH2 and its restoration resulted in decreased cell proliferation. In vivo, an inverse relationship between expression of the EZH2 and RUNX3 proteins was observed at the individual cell level in gastric cancer patients in the absence of DNA methylation in the RUNX3 promoter region. The results showed that RUNX3 is a target for repression by EZH2 and indicated an underlying mechanism of the functional role of EZH2 overexpression on cancer cell proliferation.},

Efficient function of the immune system requires homeostatic regulation from receptor recognition of antigenic challenge to cell responses and adaptation to its changing environment. It is reasonable to assume that one of the most important molecular causes of immunosenescence is alteration in the regulation of signaling pathways. Indeed, alterations in feed-forward and negative feedback (inhibitory) signaling have been highlighted in all cells involved in the immune response including short-lived (neutrophils) and long-lived (T lymphocytes) cells. These dysregulations tip the balance in favor of altered (less efficient) function of the immune system. In this review, we summarize our knowledge on signal transduction changes in the aging immune system and propose a unifying mechanism as one of the causes of immunosenescence. Modulation of these pathways with aging represents a major challenge to restore the immune response to functional levels.},

  abstract = {Introduction: c-myc is an oncogene implicated in the initiation and progression of multiple hematologic malignancies. Characteristic translocations of the c-myc gene with the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene (in Burkitt lymphoma and "double-hit" non-Hodgkin lymphoma) and with the T cell receptor gene (in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, T-ALL) lead to constitutive expression of the c-myc transcription factor, ultimately driving dysregulated proliferation (Boxer \& Dang, Oncogene 2001; 20(40):5595-5610). Strategies for inhibition of c-myc remain an area of active research; however, to date there are no approved myc-targeted agents within the cancer armamentarium, and cytotoxic chemotherapy remains the standard of care for c-myc-driven lymphoid malignancies. Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is a serine/threonine phosphatase tumor suppressor protein that contributes to c-myc degradation through both direct dephosphorylation of an identified phosphodegron as well as by indirect mechanisms (Farrell \& Sears, Cold Spring Harbor Perspect Med 2014; 4(3):1-15). Our laboratory has developed a series of first in class, orally bioavailable small molecule activators of PP2A (SMAPs) by derivatizing tricyclic antipsychotics to maximize antiproliferative activity and minimize psychotropic properties (Sangodkar et al., J Clin Invest 2017;127(6):2081-2090). We hypothesized that activation of PP2A with SMAPs would lead to c-myc degradation and tumor growth inhibition in models of c-myc-driven lymphoid malignancies. Methods: We investigated the effects of SMAP treatment on c-myc content, c-myc half-life (t1/2), cell viability, and xenograft tumor growth in Burkitt lymphoma (BL) and T-ALL cell lines with wild type and mutant c-myc phosphodegrons. Results: SMAP treatment induced apoptosis in Daudi (BL) cells, as evidenced by decreased viability and increased PARP and caspase cleavage. In Daudi (BL) and CCRF-CEM (T-ALL) cell lines, SMAP treatment led to rapid loss of phosphorylated and total c-myc protein. Cycloheximide (CHX)-chase experiments performed in CCRF-CEM cells confirmed that SMAP treatment affects c-myc degradation without affecting protein synthesis. This effect was abrogated by Ser to Glu mutation of residue 62 within the c-myc phosphodegron, suggesting that SMAP-mediated c-myc degradation is PP2A-dependent. Treatment of NOD/SCID mice bearing Daudi xenografts with twice daily oral SMAP decreased tumor c-myc content and inhibited tumor growth without obvious toxicity. Xenografts overexpressing c-myc with phosphodegron mutations (S62D, T58I) were resistant to SMAP treatment. Conclusions: These in vitro and in vivo observations establish PP2A activation as a potential pharmacologic strategy to target c-myc in cancers such as BL, T-ALL, and "double hit" non-Hodgkin lymphoma. SMAPs are well-tolerated, orally bioavailable activators of PP2A poised for further exploration in the treatment of c-myc-driven malignancies, either alone or in combination with other agents. Sequencing of the c-myc phosphodegron prior to initiation of treatment may facilitate patient selection in future clinical trials of PP2A activators. {$<$}img class="highwire-fragment fragment-image" alt="Figure" src="http://www.bloodjournal.org/content/bloodjournal/130/Suppl\_1/2819/F1.medium.gif" width="440" height="244"/{$>$}Download figureOpen in new tabDownload powerpointFigure Disclosures Narla: Mount Sinai School of Medicine: Patents \& Royalties: patents on the small molecule PP2A activators (GN).},

  abstract = {An organism with a single recessive loss-of-function allele will typically have a wild-type phenotype while individuals homozygous for two copies of the allele will display a mutant phenotype. Here, we develop a method that we refer to as the mutagenic chain reaction (MCR), which is based on the CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing system for generating autocatalytic mutations to generate homozygous loss-of-function mutations. We demonstrate in Drosophila that MCR mutations efficiently spread from their chromosome of origin to the homologous chromosome thereby converting heterozygous mutations to homozygosity in the vast majority of somatic and germline cells. MCR technology should have broad applications in diverse organisms.},

  abstract = {The EWS-FLI1 fusion oncoprotein deregulates transcription to initiate the paediatric cancer Ewing sarcoma. Here we used a domain-focused CRISPR screen to implicate the transcriptional repressor ETV6 as a unique dependency in this tumour. Using biochemical assays and epigenomics, we show that ETV6 competes with EWS-FLI1 for binding to select DNA elements enriched for short GGAA repeat sequences. Upon inactivating ETV6, EWS-FLI1 overtakes and hyper-activates these cis-elements to promote mesenchymal differentiation, with SOX11 being a key downstream target. We show that squelching of ETV6 with a dominant-interfering peptide phenocopies these effects and suppresses Ewing sarcoma growth in vivo. These findings reveal targeting of ETV6 as a strategy for neutralizing the EWS-FLI1 oncoprotein by reprogramming of genomic occupancy.},

  abstract = {Summary The heterogeneous nature of mammalian PRC1 complexes has hindered our understanding of their biological functions. Here, we present a comprehensive proteomic and genomic analysis that uncovered six major groups of PRC1 complexes, each containing a distinct PCGF subunit, a RING1A/B ubiquitin ligase, and a unique set of associated polypeptides. These PRC1 complexes differ in their genomic localization, and only a small subset colocalize with H3K27me3. Further biochemical dissection revealed that the six PCGF-RING1A/B combinations form multiple complexes through association with RYBP or its homolog YAF2, which prevents the incorporation of other canonical PRC1 subunits, such as CBX, PHC, and SCM. Although both RYBP/YAF2- and CBX/PHC/SCM-containing complexes compact chromatin, only RYBP stimulates the activity of RING1B toward H2AK119ub1, suggesting a central role in PRC1 function. Knockdown of RYBP in embryonic stem cells compromised their ability to form embryoid bodies, likely because of defects in cell proliferation and maintenance of H2AK119ub1 levels.},

Here, we provide evidence from transgenic mouse models that Crebbp deletion results in deficits in B-cell development and can cooperate with Bcl2 over-expression to promote B-cell lymphoma. Through transcriptional and epigenetic profiling of these B-cells we found that Crebbp inactivation was associated with broad transcriptional alterations, but no changes in the patterns of histone acetylation at the proximal regulatory regions of these genes. However, B-cells with Crebbp inactivation showed high expression of Myc and patterns of altered histone acetylation that were localized to intragenic regions, enriched for Myc DNA binding motifs, and showed Myc binding. Through the analysis of CREBBP mutations from a large cohort of primary human FL and DLBCL, we show a significant difference in the spectrum of CREBBP mutations in these two diseases, with higher frequencies of nonsense/frameshift mutations in DLBCL compared to FL. Together our data therefore provide important links between Crebbp inactivation and Bcl2 dependence, and show a role for Crebbp inactivation in the induction of Myc expression. We suggest this may parallel the role of CREBBP frameshift/nonsense mutations in DLBCL that result in loss of the protein, but may contrast the role of missense mutations in the lysine acetyltransferase domain that are more frequently observed in FL and yield an inactive protein.},

Few lncRNAs have been described to play a role in Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL). In this study, we carried out a genome wide lncRNA expression profiling in ALL samples and peripheral blood samples obtained from healthy donors. We detected 43 lncRNAs that were aberrantly expressed in ALL. Interestingly, among them, linc-PINT showed a significant downregulation in T and B-ALL. Re-expression of linc-PINT in ALL cells induced inhibition of leukemic cell growth that was associated with apoptosis induction and cell cycle arrest in G2/M phase. linc-PINT induced the transcription of HMOX1 which reduced the viability of ALL cells. Intriguingly, we observed that treatment with anti-tumoral epigenetic drugs like LBH-589 (Panobinostat) and Curcumin induced the expression of linc-PINT and HMOX1 in ALL. These results indicate that the downregulation of linc-PINT plays a relevant role in the pathogenesis of ALL, and linc-PINT re-expression may be one of the mechanisms exerted by epigenetic drugs to reduce cell proliferation in ALL.},

  abstract = {The murine Igh locus has a 3′ regulatory region (3′ RR) containing four enhancers (hs3A, hs1,2, hs3B, and hs4) at DNase I-hypersensitive sites. The 3′ RR exerts long-range effects on class switch recombination (CSR) to several isotypes through its control of germ line transcription. By measuring levels of acetylated histones H3 and H4 and of dimethylated H3 (K4) with chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, we found that early in B-cell development, chromatin encompassing the enhancers of the 3′ RR began to attain stepwise modifications typical of an open conformation. The hs4 enhancer was associated with active chromatin initially in pro- and pre-B cells and then together with hs3A, hs1,2, and hs3B in B and plasma cells. Histone modifications were similar in resting splenic B cells and in splenic B cells induced by lipopolysaccharide to undergo CSR. From the pro-B-cell stage onward, the ∼11-kb region immediately downstream of hs4 displayed H3 and H4 modifications indicative of open chromatin. This region contained newly identified DNase I-hypersensitive sites and several CTCF target sites, some of which were occupied in vivo in a developmentally regulated manner. The open chromatin environment of the extended 3′ RR in mature B cells was flanked by regions associated with dimethylated K9 of histone H3. Together, these data suggest that 3′ RR elements are located within a specific chromatin subdomain that contains CTCF binding sites and developmentally regulated modules.},

These results were interpreted as reflecting widespread contamination of cultures by the first established human cell line HeLa. These findings were presented at the Second Decennial Review Conference on Cell Tissue and Organ Culture4 and have since been extended to include other American Type Culture Collection lines. Further evidence on the stability of these markers in various conditions has been obtained, and in view of the widespread use of cell lines in a variety of investigations it seems important to make these findings readily accessible to other workers.},

  abstract = {The human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1), identified as the first human oncogenic retrovirus 30\,years ago, is not an ubiquitous virus. HTLV-1 is present throughout the world, with clusters of high endemicity located often nearby areas where the virus is nearly absent. The main HTLV-1 highly endemic regions are the Southwestern part of Japan, sub-Saharan Africa and South America, the Caribbean area, and foci in Middle East and Australo-Melanesia. The origin of this puzzling geographical or rather ethnic repartition is probably linked to a founder effect in some groups with the persistence of a high viral transmission rate. Despite different socio-economic and cultural environments, the HTLV-1 prevalence increases gradually with age, especially among women in all highly endemic areas. The three modes of HTLV-1 transmission are mother to child, sexual transmission, and transmission with contaminated blood products. Twenty years ago, de Thé and Bomford estimated the total number of HTLV-1 carriers to be 10–20 millions people. At that time, large regions had not been investigated, few population-based studies were available and the assays used for HTLV-1 serology were not enough specific. Despite the fact that there is still a lot of data lacking in large areas of the world and that most of the HTLV-1 studies concern only blood donors, pregnant women, or different selected patients or high-risk groups, we shall try based on the most recent data, to revisit the world distribution and the estimates of the number of HTLV-1 infected persons. Our best estimates range from 5–10 millions HTLV-1 infected individuals. However, these results were based on only approximately 1.5 billion of individuals originating from known HTLV-1 endemic areas with reliable available epidemiological data. Correct estimates in other highly populated regions, such as China, India, the Maghreb, and East Africa, is currently not possible, thus, the current number of HTLV-1 carriers is very probably much higher.},

We use our previously introduced parameter in this journal, the basic reproductive number in academia (R0), to make sense of PhD population growth in biomedical fields. Our analysis shows how R0 in biomedical fields has increased over time, and we estimate that there is approximately only one tenure-track position in the US for every 6.3 PhD graduates, which means the rest need to get jobs outside academia or stay in lower-paid temporary positions. We elaborate on the structural reasons and systemic flaws of science workforce development by discussing feedback loops, especially vicious cycles, which contribute to over-production of PhDs. We argue that the current system is unstable but with no easy solution. A way to mitigate the effects of strong reinforcing loops is full disclosure of the risks of getting PhD.},

  abstract = {Overwhelming evidence indicates that long non-coding RNAs have essential roles in tumorigenesis. Nevertheless, their role in the molecular pathogenesis of pediatric B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia has not been extensively explored. Here, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of the long non-coding RNA transcriptome in ETV6/RUNX1-positive BCP-ALL, one of the most frequent subtypes of pediatric leukemia. First, we used primary leukemia patient samples to identify an ETV6/RUNX1 specific expression signature consisting of 596 lncRNA transcripts. Next, integration of this lncRNA signature with RNA sequencing of BCP-ALL cell lines and lncRNA profiling of an in vitro model system of ETV6/RUNX1 knockdown, revealed that lnc-NKX2-3-1, lnc-TIMM21-5, lnc-ASTN1-1 and lnc-RTN4R-1 are truly regulated by the oncogenic fusion protein. Moreover, sustained inactivation of lnc-RTN4R-1 and lnc-NKX2-3-1 in ETV6/RUNX1 positive cells caused profound changes in gene expression. All together, our study defined a unique lncRNA expression signature associated with ETV6/RUNX1-positive BCP-ALL and identified lnc-RTN4R-1 and lnc-NKX2-3-1 as lncRNAs that might be functionally implicated in the biology of this prevalent subtype of human leukemia.},

Emerging evidence highlights a role for histone variants and their dedicated chaperones in cancer initiation and progression. Histone variants are involved in processes as diverse as maintenance of genome integrity, nuclear architecture and cell identity. On a molecular level, histone variants add a layer of complexity to the dynamic regulation of transcription, DNA replication and repair, and mitotic chromosome segregation. Because these functions are critical to ensure normal proliferation and maintenance of cellular fate, cancer cells are defined by their capacity to subvert them. Hijacking histone variants and their chaperones is emerging as a common means to disrupt homeostasis across a wide range of cancers, particularly solid tumours. Here we discuss histone variants and histone chaperones as tumour-promoting or tumour-suppressive players in the pathogenesis of cancer.},

This presents several key questions for drug development, including which transporters are clinically important in drug absorption and disposition, and which in vitro methods are suitable for studying drug interactions with these transporters. In addition, what criteria should trigger follow-up clinical studies, and which clinical studies should be conducted if needed. In this article, we provide the recommendations of the International Transporter Consortium on these issues, and present decision trees that are intended to help guide clinical studies on the currently recognized most important drug transporter interactions. The recommendations are generally intended to support clinical development and filing of a new drug application. Overall, it is advised that the timing of transporter investigations should be driven by efficacy, safety and clinical trial enrolment questions (for example, exclusion and inclusion criteria), as well as a need for further understanding of the absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion properties of the drug molecule, and information required for drug labelling.},

The present study aimed at testing whether such a stimulation also occurs in vivo. Transcytosis of pIgR was monitored by rat liver output of total secretory component (SC) into bile, measured by radial immunodiffusion as the sum of free SC and pIgA-bound SC. Whereas in the perfused rat liver system addition of pIgA to the perfusate showed no effect, i.v. injection of human and rat pIgA, but not of monomeric IgA nor PBS, in living rats significantly increased total bile SC output for more than 1 h. Furthermore, depletion of the normal pIgA level circulating in the liver before injecting more pIgA was not required to show the stimulation. Our data thus strongly suggest that stimulation of liver pIgR transcytosis by pIgA ligand binding is physiologically relevant, helping to quickly adjust pIgA transport into bile to increase circulating pIgA levels, without need for increased SC/pIgR synthesis.},

Knowledge about the implications of Tregs for the behaviour of haematological malignancies is limited. In this study, skin biopsies from 86 patients with mycosis fungoides (MF) and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) unspecified were analysed for the expression of FOXP3 on tumour cells and tumour-infiltrating Tregs. Labelling of above 10\% of the neoplastic cells was seen in one case classified as an aggressive epidermotropic CD8+ cytotoxic CTCL. In the remaining 85 cases, the atypical neoplastic infiltrate was either FOXP3 negative (n=80) or contained only very occasional weakly positive cells (n=5). By contrast, all biopsies showed varying numbers of strongly FOXP3+ tumour-infiltrating Tregs. MF with early or infiltrated plaques had significantly higher numbers of FOXP3+ Tregs than CTCL unspecified or advanced MF with tumours or transformation to large cell lymphoma. An analysis of all patients demonstrated that increasing numbers of FOXP3+ Tregs were associated with improved survival in both MF and CTCL unspecified. In conclusion, our data indicate that the presence of FOXP3+ Tregs in CTCL is associated with disease stage and patient survival.},

  abstract = {CLL cases display heterogeneous responses to B cell receptor (BCR) engagement which correlate with clinical course and survival. Typically, cases with more aggressive disease show greater activation of downstream signaling molecules, such as the kinases SYK, AKT and ERK, upon BCR engagement. The heterogeneous BCR signaling responses have been attributed to varying levels of anergy occurring as a consequence of chronic antigen engagement in the absence of T cell help. However, an alternative explanation for the anergic phenotype is that it is induced by binding of serum IgM to the high-affinity Fcμ receptor (FCMR), which is highly overexpressed on CLL cells and has been reported to physically interact with the BCR in normal murine B cells. To investigate whether binding of soluble IgM to the FCMR can affect BCR signaling, we investigated activation of downstream BCR signaling molecules in primary CLL B cells after FCMR prestimulation with monoclonal IgM or Fcμ fragment followed by BCR stimulation with polyclonal anti-light chain antibody. For 10 of the 18 cases tested, substantial reduction in the levels of phospho-SYK, phospho-AKT and phospho-ERK was observed in IgM- or Fcμ-prestimulated CLL cells consistent with FCMR stimulation inhibiting BCR signaling. Stimulation with IgM or Fcμ did not cause any appreciable change in surface IgM expression, suggesting that inhibition of BCR signaling is not caused by receptor downmodulation but rather by recruitment of negative regulatory mechanism(s). Investigation of these mechanisms is still ongoing, but preliminary data suggest involvement of the phosphatases SHIP and SHP1. To investigate the impact of serum IgM/FCMR interactions on the clinical course, we correlated FCMR expression and serum IgM levels with treatment-free survival (TFS) in a large series of CLL patients (Figure 1). Cases with FCMR expression levels below median value (n=67) had a median TFS of 41 months, which was significantly shorter compared to cases with FCMR levels equal to or above median value (n=71, median TFS=132 months, P{$<$}0.001). This difference did not correlate with higher expression of FCMR on IGHV-mutated (M-CLL) cases (n=80, mean MFI=123+/-79), considering that no difference was observed with respect to the IGHV-unmutated (U-CLL) cases (n=58, mean MFI=114+/-127, P=n.s). Interestingly, when analyzed independently, only M-CLL cases showed a significant correlation with TFS (FCMRlow cases: n=36, median TFS=75 months; FCMRhigh cases: n=44, median TFS=170 months, P=0.006); this difference was lost in U-CLL cases (FCMRlow cases: n=31, median TFS=21; FCMRhigh cases: n=27, median TFS=31, P=n.s.). In contrast, serum IgM levels below normal range ({$<$}40 mg/dl) significantly correlated with shorter TFS in U-CLL (low serum IgM cases: n=28, median TFS=20 months; normal serum IgM cases: n=44, median TFS=51 months, P=0.009) but not in M-CLL (low serum IgM cases: n=34, median TFS=83 months; normal serum IgM cases: n=72, median TFS=125 months, P=n.s.). To further establish whether low serum IgM levels are a cause rather than a consequence of clinically more aggressive disease, we are currently conducting experiments with leukemias derived from the Eμ-TCL1 CLL model that have been adoptively transferred into secretory IgM-deficient or normal mice; the results from these ongoing experiments will be presented at the meeting. Collectively, these data show that serum IgM/FCMR interactions inhibit BCR signaling, which could at least in part explain the anergic phenotype of peripheral blood CLL cells. Along with our finding that the FCMR is downregulated by IL4 and expressed at lower levels on LN compared to PB CLL cells (Gobessi S et al, Blood 2016 128:2015), these data suggest that serum IgM/FCMR interactions are involved in regulating the intensity of the BCR signal in different compartments and consequently can influence the clinical behavior of the disease. {$<$}img class="highwire-fragment fragment-image" alt="Figure1" src="http://www.bloodjournal.org/content/bloodjournal/132/Suppl\_1/4409/F1.medium.gif" width="440" height="338"/{$>$}Download figureOpen in new tabDownload powerpoint Disclosures Chen: Janssen: Research Funding; Pharmacyclics: Research Funding; ArgenX: Research Funding; Beigene: Research Funding; Verastem: Research Funding.

  abstract = {Expression of ZAP-70 is an important negative prognostic factor in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). This protein tyrosine kinase is a key mediator of T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling and is structurally homologous to Syk, which plays an analogous role in B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling. Recent studies indicate that ZAP-70 may participate in BCR signaling as well, but the mechanism of action is not completely understood. We have now compared antigen receptor-induced activation of ZAP-70 in B cells and T cells by analyzing phosphorylation of critical regulatory tyrosine residues. We show that BCR-mediated activation of ZAP-70 is very inefficient in CLL and lymphoma B cells and is negligible when compared to activation of Syk. Despite the inefficient catalytic activation, the ability of ZAP-70 to recruit downstream signaling molecules in response to antigen receptor stimulation appeared relatively preserved. Moreover, ectopic expression of ZAP-70 enhanced and prolonged activation of several key mediators of BCR signaling, such as the Syk, ERK, and Akt kinases, and decreased the rate of ligand-mediated BCR internalization. We conclude that the role of ZAP-70 in BCR signaling is quite distinct from its role in TCR signaling and is likely mediated by inhibition of events that terminate the signaling response.},

  abstract = {Complement-dependent cytotoxicity is thought to be an important mechanism of action of the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab. This study investigates the sensitivity of freshly isolated cells obtained from 33 patients with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL), 5 patients with prolymphocytic leukemia (PLL), and 6 patients with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) to be lysed by rituximab and complement in vitro. The results showed that in B-CLL and PLL, the levels of CD20, measured by standard immunofluorescence or using calibrated beads, correlated linearly with the lytic response (coefficient greater than or equal to 0.9;P {$<$} .0001). Furthermore, the correlation remained highly significant when the 6 patients with MCL were included in the analysis (coefficient 0.91; P {$<$} .0001), which suggests that CD20 levels primarily determine lysis regardless of diagnostic group. The role of the complement inhibitors CD46, CD55, and CD59 was also investigated. All B-CLL and PLL cells expressed these molecules, but at different levels. CD46 was relatively weak on all samples (mean fluorescence intensity less than 100), whereas CD55 and CD59 showed variability of expression (mean fluorescence intensity 20-1200 and 20-250, respectively). Although CD55 and CD59 levels did not permit prediction of complement susceptibility, the functional block of these inhibitors demonstrated that they play an important role in regulating complement-dependent cytotoxicity. Thus, lysis of poorly responding B-CLL samples was increased 5- to 6-fold after blocking both CD55 and CD59, whereas that of high responders was essentially complete in the presence of a single blocking antibody. These data demonstrate that CD20, CD55, and CD59 are important factors determining the in vitro response to rituximab and complement and indicate potential strategies to improve the clinical response to this biologic therapy.},

It is now possible to examine these interactions at the molecular level, and we have gained glimpses of their functional implications. Chromosomal interactions can contribute to the silencing and activation of genes within the three-dimensional context of the nuclear architecture.

  abstract = {Breast cancer is the second-leading cause of cancer-related deaths in women, but the details of how it begins remain elusive. Increasing evidence supports the association of aggressive triple-negative (TN) breast cancer with heightened expression of the Polycomb group protein Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 (EZH2) and increased tumor-initiating cells (TICs). However, mechanistic links between EZH2 and TICs are unclear, and direct demonstration of a tumorigenic function of EZH2 in vivo is lacking. Here, we identify an unrecognized EZH2/NOTCH1 axis that controls breast TICs in TN breast carcinomas. EZH2 overexpression increases NOTCH1 expression and signaling, and inhibition of NOTCH1 activity prevents EZH2-mediated stem cell expansion in nontumorigenic breast cells. We uncover a unique role of EZH2 in activating, rather than repressing, NOTCH1 signaling through binding to the NOTCH1 promoter in TN breast cancer cells. EZH2 binding is independent of its catalytic histone H3 lysine 27 methyltransferase activity and of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 but corresponds instead to transcriptional activation marks. In vivo, EZH2 knockdown decreases the onset and volume of xenografts derived from TN breast TICs. Conversely, transgenic EZH2 overexpression accelerates mammary tumor initiation and increases NOTCH1 activation in mouse mammary tumor virus-neu mice. Consonant with these findings, in clinical samples, high levels of EZH2 are significantly associated with activated NOTCH1 protein and increased TICs in TN invasive carcinomas. These data reveal a functional and mechanistic link between EZH2 levels, NOTCH1 signaling activation, and TICs, and provide previously unidentified evidence that EZH2 enhances breast cancer initiation.},

Although much progress has been made in revealing the transcriptional regulation of B-cell differentiation that occurs during humoral immune responses, there are still many questions that remain unanswered. Recent work on the expression and roles of histone modifiers in lymphocytes has begun to shed light on this additional level of regulation. This review will discuss the recent advancements in understanding how humoral immune responses, in particular germinal centers and memory cells, are modulated by histone modifiers.},

Memory B cells, which are responsible for this phenomenon, undergo greater proliferation and differentiation into Ig-secreting plasma cells than naïve B cells. We have found that memory cells rapidly enter cell division, irrespective of extrinsic stimuli. Microarray analysis of human splenic B cells revealed that naïve cells express higher levels than memory B cells of Krüppel-like factor (KLF) 4, KLF9, and promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF), transcription factors important in maintaining cellular quiescence. These genes were down-regulated after activation through CD40 and the B cell receptor. Enforced expression of KLF4, KLF9, and PLZF in memory B cells delayed their entry into division and reduced the number of proliferating cells, such that the behavior of transfected memory cells resembled that of naïve B cells. Thus, the accelerated response of memory B cells correlates with reduced expression of KLF4, KLF9, and PLZF and the subsequent regulatory effects they exert on the cell cycle.},

  abstract = {B-cell malignancies, such as human Burkitt's lymphoma, often contain translocations that link c-myc or other proto-oncogenes to the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus (IgH, encoded by Igh). The nature of elements that activate oncogenes within such translocations has been a long-standing question. Translocations within Igh involve DNA double-strand breaks initiated either by the RAG1/2 endonuclease during variable, diversity and joining gene segment (V(D)J) recombination, or by activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID, also known as AICDA) during class switch recombination (CSR). V(D)J recombination in progenitor B (pro-B) cells assembles Igh variable region exons upstream of mu constant region (Cmu) exons, which are the first of several sets of C(H) exons ('C(H) genes') within a C(H) locus that span several hundred kilobases (kb). In mature B cells, CSR deletes Cmu and replaces it with a downstream C(H) gene. An intronic enhancer (iEmu) between the variable region exons and Cmu promotes V(D)J recombination in developing B cells. Furthermore, the Igh 3' regulatory region (Igh3'RR) lies downstream of the C(H) locus and modulates CSR by long-range transcriptional enhancement of C(H) genes. Transgenic mice bearing iEmu or Igh3'RR sequences fused to c-myc are predisposed to B lymphomas, demonstrating that such elements can confer oncogenic c-myc expression. However, in many B-cell lymphomas, Igh-c-myc translocations delete iEmu and place c-myc up to 200 kb upstream of the Igh3'RR. Here we address the oncogenic role of the Igh3'RR by inactivating it in two distinct mouse models for B-cell lymphoma with Igh-c-myc translocations. We show that the Igh3'RR is dispensable for pro-B-cell lymphomas with V(D)J recombination-initiated translocations, but is required for peripheral B-cell lymphomas with CSR-associated translocations. As the Igh3'RR is not required for CSR-associated Igh breaks or Igh-c-myc translocations in peripheral B-cell lymphoma progenitors, we conclude that this regulatory region confers oncogenic activity by long-range and developmental stage-specific activation of translocated c-myc genes.},

In one approach, efforts to understand the underlying cell-autonomous, genetic drivers of tumorigenesis have led to the development of clinically important targeted agents that result in profound, but often not durable, tumour responses in genetically defined patient populations. In the second parallel approach, exploration of the mechanisms of protective tumour immunity has provided several therapeutic strategies — most notably the 'immune checkpoint' antibodies that reverse the negative regulators of T cell function — that accomplish durable clinical responses in subsets of patients with various tumour types. The integration of these potentially complementary research fields provides new opportunities to improve cancer treatments. Targeted and immune-based therapies have already transformed the standard-of-care for several malignancies. However, additional insights into the effects of targeted therapies, along with conventional chemotherapy and radiation therapy, on the induction of antitumour immunity will help to advance the design of combination strategies that increase the rate of complete and durable clinical response in patients.},

  abstract = {The possibility that activated B cells might express a ligand for CD40 that was of functional importance for B cell responses was examined by using highly purified human peripheral blood B cells, as well as a variety of B lymphoblastoid cell lines and hybridomas. Following stimulation with the combination of a calcium ionophore and a phorbol ester, human B cells bound a soluble fusion protein containing the extracellular portion of CD40 and the Fc region of IgG1 (CD40.Ig). A variety of B cell lines and hybridomas also bound CD40.Ig, either constitutively or after activation. In addition, CD40.Ig specifically immunoprecipitated a 33-kDa glycoprotein from surface 125I-labeled activated B cells. The nucleotide sequence of the coding region of the CD40 ligand mRNA amplified by RT-PCR from activated T cells and B cell lines was identical. The CD40 ligand expressed on human B cells was important functionally because homotypic aggregation of CD40 ligand-expressing B cells was inhibited by the CD40.Ig construct. Additionally, RNA and DNA synthesis as well as Ig production by polyclonally activated, highly purified peripheral B cells and a variety of B cell lines were inhibited significantly by the CD40.Ig construct. Finally, B cell lines expressing the CD40 ligand induced Ig production from resting normal B cells in a CD40-dependent manner. These results indicate that human B cells express a ligand for CD40 that is identical with that expressed by activated T cells and that the B cell-expressed CD40 ligand plays an important role in facilitating responses of activated B cells.},

Although the overall survival of FL patients has recently improved with the introduction of novel therapies, there is significant heterogeneity in patient outcome and a need for rationally designed therapeutic strategies that target disease biology. Next-generation sequencing studies have identified chromatin modifying gene (CMG) mutations as a hallmark of FL, highlighting epigenetic modifiers as an attractive therapeutic target in this disease. Understanding the complex roles of these mutations will be central to identifying and adaptively targeting associated vulnerabilities. Recent studies have provided insight into the functional consequences of the most frequently mutated CMGs (KMT2D, CREBBP, and EZH2) and point to a role for these events in modifying normal B-cell differentiation programs and impeding germinal center exit. However, the majority of FL tumors serially acquire multiple CMG mutations, suggesting that there is a level of cross talk or cooperation between these events that has not yet been defined. Here, I review the current state of knowledge on CMG mutations in FL, discuss their potential as therapeutic targets, and offer my perspective on unexplored areas that should be considered in the future.},

  abstract = {Ageing is a complex process that negatively impacts the development of the immune system and its ability to function. The mechanisms that underlie these age-related defects are broad and range from defects in the haematopoietic bone marrow to defects in peripheral lymphocyte migration, maturation and function. The thymus is a central lymphoid organ responsible for production of naïve T cells, which play a vital role in mediating both cellular and humoral immunity. Chronic involution of the thymus gland is thought to be one of the major contributing factors to loss of immune function with increasing age. It has recently been demonstrated that thymic atrophy is mediated by a shift from a stimulatory to a suppressive cytokine microenvironment. In this review we present an overview of the morphological, cellular and biochemical changes that have been implicated in the decline of thymic and peripheral immune function with ageing. We conclude with the clinical implications of age-associated immunosenescence to vaccine development for tumours and infectious disease. A fundamental understanding of the complex mechanisms by which ageing attenuates immune function will enable translational research teams to develop new therapies and vaccines specifically aimed at overcoming these defects in immunological function in the aged.

Here, we define the core regulatory circuitry of rhabdomyosarcoma and identify critical CR TF dependencies. These CR TFs build SEs that have the highest levels of histone acetylation, yet paradoxically the same SEs also harbor the greatest amounts of histone deacetylases. We find that hyperacetylation selectively halts CR TF transcription. To investigate the architectural determinants of this phenotype, we used absolute quantification of architecture (AQuA) HiChIP, which revealed erosion of native SE contacts, and aberrant spreading of contacts that involved histone acetylation. Hyperacetylation removes RNA polymerase II (RNA Pol II) from core regulatory genetic elements, and eliminates RNA Pol II but not BRD4 phase condensates. This study identifies an SE-specific requirement for balancing histone modification states to maintain SE architecture and CR TF transcription.},

  abstract = {Somatic hypermutation and class switch recombination of the immunoglobulin (Ig) genes occur in germinal center (GC) B cells and are initiated through deamination of cytidine to uracil by activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID). Resulting uracil-guanine mismatches are subsequently processed by UNG-mediated base-excision repair (BER) and MSH2-mediated mismatch repair (MMR) to yield mutations and DNA strand lesions. Although off-target AID activity also contributes to oncogenic point mutations and chromosome translocations associated with GC and post-GC B cell lymphomas, the role of downstream AID-associated DNA repair pathways in the pathogenesis of lymphoma is unknown. Here, we show that simultaneous deficiency of UNG and MSH2 or MSH2 alone causes genomic instability and a shorter latency to the development of BCL6-driven diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) in a murine model. Despite its mutagenic role during immune diversification, the additional development of several other types of BCL6-independent malignancies underscores the critical role of MMR in maintaining general genomic stability. In contrast, absence of UNG alone is highly protective and prevents the development of BCL6-driven DLBCL. We further demonstrate in the DLBCLs that clonal and non-clonal mutations arise within non-Ig AID target genes in the combined absence of UNG and MSH2 and that DNA strand lesions can arise in an UNG-dependent manner but are offset by MSH2. These findings lend insight into a complex interplay whereby potentially lymphomagenic UNG activity and general genomic instability are opposed by the protective influence of MSH2, producing a net protective effect that promotes SHM and CSR of the Ig genes while simultaneously attenuating malignant transformation of GC B cells.},

  abstract = {As the most prevalent and lethal type of brain tumours, gliomas, especially malignant ones, are relatively resistant to conventional therapies. Gremlin 1 (GREM1) is a secreted glycoprotein that is implicated in the maintenance of cancer stem cells in tumour hierarchy. In the current study, the role of GREM1 in the carcinogenesis of glioma was studied using a knockdown approach. We first examined the expression level of GREM1 in the clinical samples, and then evaluated the effect of GREM1 knockdown on the viability and colony formation capacity of U87-MG cells. Moreover, the migration ability, invasiveness, cell cycle, and apoptosis of GREM1-silenced cells were assessed. Furthermore, the involvement of functional GREM1 in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process of glioma was investigated by detecting the expression levels of glioma-associated oncogene homologue 3 (GLI3) and EMT-related molecules. Our results demonstrated that knockdown of GREM1 reduced cell viability, suppressed migration and invasion, and inhibited GLI3 expression and the EMT process in U87-MG cells. Meanwhile, GREM1 silencing promoted apoptosis in U87-MG cells through the accumulation of Bax, cleaved caspase-3, and cleaved poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) as well as the downregulation of Bcl-2. In addition, GREM1 knockdown abolished transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1-mediated activation of the Smad pathway, which may underlie the mechanism of GREM1-regulated EMT. In conclusion, GREM1 plays an important role in the development of glioma, and it may serve as a potential target in glioma therapy.},

  abstract = {Background: The Fc receptor for IgM (FcmR/ TOSO) is significantly overexpressed on chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells from peripheral blood, but becomes down-regulated in the tumor microenvironment by e.g. CD40:CD40L interaction. Since the functional role of FcmR on lymphomagenesis is still not understood, we developed a conditional knockout mouse with B cell-specific FcmR-depletion. These mice were crossbred with the Eµ-TCL1 murine model, which develops a CLL-like phenotype. Results: The depletion of FcmR/TOSO in TCL1 mice (Eµ-Tcl1tg/wt FcmRfl/fl CD19cre/wt; further on called TCT) revealed a significantly shorter overall survival (296 days; n=40) compared to the TOSO expressing control mice (Eµ-Tcl1tg/wt FcmRwt/wt CD19cre/wt; TC; 344 days; n=106; Log-rank p{$<$}0.0001). In addition, these mice show a significantly higher blood leukocyte count and lower platelet and erythrocyte count. Leukocytes could be identified as CLL-characteristic leukemic CD19+/CD5+ B cells. Altogether TCT exhibited a faster progress of disease. Spleen immunohistochemistry revealed the transformation of most TCT (14/17 transformed) into an even more aggressive phenotype with increased splenomegaly and change in tissue and cell morphology compared to TC (9/9 not transformed). While characterizing these cells by flow cytometry, we identified a significantly higher expression of IgM on malignant B cells from TCT in comparison to TC mice. This finding indicates that the BCR itself might have a different contribution to lymphomagenesis in FcmR knock-out settings. Therefore, to validate the functional role of FcmR in the process of lymphomagenesis, we performed transcriptome profiling by RNA-Seq using splenic leukemic cells (CD19+ CD5+) from 36-week old TC (n=4) and TCT (n=4) mice. 2089 genes were found to be significantly modulated in the malignant cells of TCT mice, from which 1221 were downregulated and 868 showed an upregulation (significant change in mean expression; p{$<$}0.05). To investigate the role of IgM on TCT mice, purified malignant B cells were incubated for two hours with F(ab')2 goat anti-mouse IgM. Strikingly, TCT mice showed 3941 genes (2054 downregulated, 1887 upregulated) with significant difference in expression compared to TC (p{$<$}0.05). The gene expression profiles of the anti-IgM treated mice revealed a stronger regulation of BCR signalling in TCT mice, suggesting that FcmR represents an important factor in these processes. We examined the gene expression profiles, using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis Software. Analysis revealed that the most deregulated functions include interferon-signalling, recruitment of leukocytes, infection of cells and cellular movement. Conclusion: Here we present functional evidence that loss of FcmR results in increased IgM/BCR on the surface of non-switched leukemia. Moreover, malignant cells with loss of FcmR are more susceptible to BCR stimulation and show a signature of signalling pathways, which contribute to inflammation in B cell malignancies.

  abstract = {Pericytes and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are ontogenically related, and in fact, no significant phenotypic differences could be observed by flow cytometry. Transcriptome analysis of human pericytes and MSCs revealed that 43 genes were up-regulated more than 10-fold in pericytes compared with MSCs. Identification of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) as one of the most abundant RNA species in pericytes with respect to MSCs and confirmation of TLR4 expression on the cell surface led us to obtain a comprehensive overview of the expression program of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated pericytes. Transcriptional profiling of LPS-treated cells revealed that 22 genes were up-regulated more than 5-fold. Of them, 10 genes encoded chemokines and cytokines (CXCL10, CCL20, IL8, CXCL1, IL6, CCL2, IL1B, CXCL2, IL1A, and CXCL6), and three genes encoded adhesion molecules (ICAM1, VCAM1, and SELE). LPS induced nuclear translocation of the transcription factor NF-κB in stimulated pericytes. Moreover, inhibition of NF-κB activation by SC-514 blocked LPS-induced up-regulation of a subset of chemokine genes, confirming the key role of NF-κB in LPS signaling in pericytes. At the protein level, we assessed the secretion of the proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines IL-6, IL-8, CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL3, and CCL2 not only after LPS treatment but also in HMGB1-stimulated pericytes. Up-regulation of the adhesion molecules ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 resulted in an increased adhesion of peripheral blood leukocytes to an LPS-treated pericyte monolayer. The role of pericytes in the inflammatory context has been scarcely addressed; according to these results, pericytes should be considered as active players in the inflammatory cascade with potential physiopathological implications.},

Mutations in the DNA methylation regulators DNMT3A, TET1/2, and IDH1/2 are recurrent in leukemia and lymphoma. Specific and distinct DNA methylation patterns characterize subtypes of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and lymphoma. Regulatory regions such as promoter CpG islands, CpG shores, and enhancers show changes in methylation during transformation. However, the reported poor correlation between changes in methylation and gene expression in many mouse models and human studies reflects the complexity in the precise molecular mechanism for why aberrant DNA methylation promotes malignancies. This review summarizes current concepts regarding the mechanisms behind aberrant DNA methylation in hematopoietic malignancy and discusses its importance in cancer prognosis, tumor heterogeneity, and relapse.},

  abstract = {DNA methylation is an important epigenetic modification involved in many biological processes and diseases. Many studies have mapped DNA methylation changes associated with embryogenesis, cell differentiation and cancer at a genome-wide scale. Our understanding of genome-wide DNA methylation changes in a developmental or disease-related context has been steadily growing. However, the investigation of which CpGs are variably methylated in different normal cell or tissue types is still limited. Here we present an in-depth analysis of 54 single-CpG-resolution DNA methylomes of normal human cell types by integrating high-throughput sequencing-based methylation data. We found that the ratio of methylated to unmethylated CpGs is relatively constant regardless of cell type. However, which CpGs made up the unmethylated complement was cell-type specific. We categorized the 26 million human autosomal CpGs based on their methylation levels across multiple cell types to identify variably methylated CpGs. 22.6\% exhibited variable DNA methylation across cell types included in our study. These variably methylated CpGs formed 660 thousand variably methylated regions (VMRs), encompassing 11\% of the genome. By integrating a multitude of genomic data, we found that VMRs enrich for histone modifications indicative of enhancers, suggesting their role as regulatory elements marking cell type specificity. VMRs enriched for transcription factor binding sites in a tissue-dependent manner. Importantly, they enriched for GWAS variants, suggesting VMRs could potentially be implicated in disease and complex traits. Taken together, our results highlight the link among CpG methylation variation, genetic variation and disease risk for many human cell types.},

  abstract = {CTCF and the associated cohesin complex play a central role in insulator function and higher-order chromatin organization of mammalian genomes. Recent studies identified a correlation between the orientation of CTCF-binding sites (CBSs) and chromatin loops. To test the functional significance of this observation, we combined CRISPR/Cas9-based genomic-DNA-fragment editing with chromosome-conformation-capture experiments to show that the location and relative orientations of CBSs determine the specificity of long-range chromatin looping in mammalian genomes, using protocadherin (Pcdh) and β-globin as model genes. Inversion of CBS elements within the Pcdh enhancer reconfigures the topology of chromatin loops between the distal enhancer and target promoters and alters gene-expression patterns. Thus, although enhancers can function in an orientation-independent manner in reporter assays, in the native chromosome context, the orientation of at least some enhancers carrying CBSs can determine both the architecture of topological chromatin domains and enhancer/promoter specificity. These findings reveal how 3D chromosome architecture can be encoded by linear genome sequences.},

These modifications enable scRRBS to provide digitized methylation information on ∼1 million CpG sites within an individual diploid mouse or human cell at single-base resolution. Compared with the single-cell bisulfite sequencing (scBS) technique, scRRBS covers fewer CpG sites, but it provides better coverage for CpG islands (CGIs), which are likely to be the most informative elements for DNA methylation. The entire procedure takes ∼3 weeks, and it requires strong molecular biology skills.},

Recent studies of dosage compensation, imprinting, and homeotic gene expression suggest that individual lincRNAs can function as the interface between DNA and specific chromatin remodelling activities. Here we show that lincRNAs in the HOX loci become systematically dysregulated during breast cancer progression. The lincRNA termed HOTAIR is increased in expression in primary breast tumours and metastases, and HOTAIR expression level in primary tumours is a powerful predictor of eventual metastasis and death. Enforced expression of HOTAIR in epithelial cancer cells induced genome-wide re-targeting of Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) to an occupancy pattern more resembling embryonic fibroblasts, leading to altered histone H3 lysine 27 methylation, gene expression, and increased cancer invasiveness and metastasis in a manner dependent on PRC2. Conversely, loss of HOTAIR can inhibit cancer invasiveness, particularly in cells that possess excessive PRC2 activity. These findings indicate that lincRNAs have active roles in modulating the cancer epigenome and may be important targets for cancer diagnosis and therapy.},

  abstract = {The contribution of repetitive elements to quantitative human traits is largely unknown. Here we report a genome-wide survey of the contribution of short tandem repeats (STRs), which constitute one of the most polymorphic and abundant repeat classes, to gene expression in humans. Our survey identified 2,060 significant expression STRs (eSTRs). These eSTRs were replicable in orthogonal populations and expression assays. We used variance partitioning to disentangle the contribution of eSTRs from that of linked SNPs and indels and found that eSTRs contribute 10–15\% of the cis heritability mediated by all common variants. Further functional genomic analyses showed that eSTRs are enriched in conserved regions, colocalize with regulatory elements and may modulate certain histone modifications. By analyzing known genome-wide association study (GWAS) signals and searching for new associations in 1,685 whole genomes from deeply phenotyped individuals, we found that eSTRs are enriched in various clinically relevant conditions. These results highlight the contribution of STRs to the genetic architecture of quantitative human traits.},

Here we show PRDI-BF1 assembles silent chromatin over the interferon-β promoter in the osteosarcoma cell line U2OS through recruitment of the histone H3 lysine methyltransferase G9a. G9a is recruited only when in a complex with PRDI-BF1. G9a catalytic activity is required for the accumulation of methylated histone H3 and transcriptional silencing mediated by PRDI-BF1 in vivo. This establishes a mechanism for the recruitment of G9a, the main mammalian euchromatic methyltransferase, and defines nonembryonic targets of G9a.},

To address this, we present a modeling framework for the normalization and variance stabilization of molecular count data from scRNA-seq experiments. We propose that the Pearson residuals from “regularized negative binomial regression,” where cellular sequencing depth is utilized as a covariate in a generalized linear model, successfully remove the influence of technical characteristics from downstream analyses while preserving biological heterogeneity. Importantly, we show that an unconstrained negative binomial model may overfit scRNA-seq data, and overcome this by pooling information across genes with similar abundances to obtain stable parameter estimates. Our procedure omits the need for heuristic steps including pseudocount addition or log-transformation and improves common downstream analytical tasks such as variable gene selection, dimensional reduction, and differential expression. Our approach can be applied to any UMI-based scRNA-seq dataset and is freely available as part of the R package sctransform, with a direct interface to our single-cell toolkit Seurat.},

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: Single-cell technologies have recently gained popularity in cellular differentiation studies regarding their ability to resolve potential heterogeneities in cell populations. Analyzing such high-dimensional single-cell data has its own statistical and computational challenges. Popular multivariate approaches are based on data normalization, followed by dimension reduction and clustering to identify subgroups. However, in the case of cellular differentiation, we would not expect clear clusters to be present but instead expect the cells to follow continuous branching lineages. RESULTS: Here, we propose the use of diffusion maps to deal with the problem of defining differentiation trajectories. We adapt this method to single-cell data by adequate choice of kernel width and inclusion of uncertainties or missing measurement values, which enables the establishment of a pseudotemporal ordering of single cells in a high-dimensional gene expression space. We expect this output to reflect cell differentiation trajectories, where the data originates from intrinsic diffusion-like dynamics. Starting from a pluripotent stage, cells move smoothly within the transcriptional landscape towards more differentiated states with some stochasticity along their path. We demonstrate the robustness of our method with respect to extrinsic noise (e.g. measurement noise) and sampling density heterogeneities on simulated toy data as well as two single-cell quantitative polymerase chain reaction datasets (i.e. mouse haematopoietic stem cells and mouse embryonic stem cells) and an RNA-Seq data of human pre-implantation embryos. We show that diffusion maps perform considerably better than Principal Component Analysis and are advantageous over other techniques for non-linear dimension reduction such as t-distributed Stochastic Neighbour Embedding for preserving the global structures and pseudotemporal ordering of cells.

Their origin has been ascribed to selection of random rearrangements, targeted DNA damage, or frequent nuclear interactions between translocation partners; however, the relative contribution of each of these elements has not been measured directly or on a large scale. Here we examine the role of nuclear architecture and frequency of DNA damage in the genesis of chromosomal translocations by measuring these parameters simultaneously in cultured mouse B lymphocytes. In the absence of recurrent DNA damage, translocations between Igh or Myc and all other genes are directly related to their contact frequency. Conversely, translocations associated with recurrent site-directed DNA damage are proportional to the rate of DNA break formation, as measured by replication protein A accumulation at the site of damage. Thus, non-targeted rearrangements reflect nuclear organization whereas DNA break formation governs the location and frequency of recurrent translocations, including those driving B-cell malignancies.},

  abstract = {Motivation: Viruses, from the human protein–protein interaction network perspective, target hubs, bottlenecks and interconnected nodes enriched in certain biological pathways. However, not much is known about the general characteristic features of the human proteins interacting with viral proteins (referred to as hVIPs) as well as the motifs and domains utilized by human-virus protein–protein interactions (referred to as Hu-Vir PPIs). Results: Our study has revealed that hVIPs are mostly disordered proteins, whereas viral proteins are mostly ordered proteins. Protein disorder in viral proteins and hVIPs varies from one subcellular location to another. In any given viral-human PPI pair, at least one of the two proteins is structurally disordered suggesting that disorder associated conformational flexibility as one of the characteristic features of virus–host interaction. Further analyses reveal that hVIPs are (i) slowly evolving proteins, (ii) associated with high centrality scores in human-PPI network, (iii) involved in multiple pathways, (iv) enriched in eukaryotic linear motifs (ELMs) associated with protein modification, degradation and regulatory processes, (v) associated with high number of splice variants and (vi) expressed abundantly across multiple tissues. These aforementioned findings suggest that conformational flexibility, spatial diversity, abundance and slow evolution are the characteristic features of the human proteins targeted by viral proteins. Hu-Vir PPIs are mostly mediated via domain–motif interactions (DMIs) where viral proteins employ motifs that mimic host ELMs to bind to domains in human proteins. DMIs are shared among viruses belonging to different families indicating a possible convergent evolution of these motifs to help viruses to adopt common strategies to subvert host cellular pathways.

We show here that, next  to a naive compartment, two discrete primed subpopulations can be found within the circulating human CD8+ T cell subset. First, CD45RA−CD45R0+ cells are reminiscent of memory-type T cells in that they express elevated levels of CD95 (Fas) and the integrin family members  CD11a, CD18, CD29, CD49d, and CD49e, compared to naive CD8+ T cells, and are able to  secrete not only interleukin (IL) 2 but also interferon γ, tumor necrosis factor α, and IL-4. This  subset does not exert cytolytic activity without prior in vitro stimulation but does contain virus-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) precursors. A second primed population is characterized by CD45RA expression with concomitant absence of expression of the costimulatory  molecules CD27 and CD28. The CD8+CD45RA+CD27− population contains T cells expressing high levels of CD11a, CD11b, CD18, and CD49d, whereas CD62L (L-selectin) is not  expressed. These T cells do not secrete IL-2 or -4 but can produce IFN-γ and TNF-α. In accordance with this finding, cells contained within this subpopulation depend for proliferation  on exogenous growth factors such as IL-2 and -15. Interestingly, CD8+CD45RA+CD27− cells  parallel effector CTLs, as they abundantly express Fas-ligand mRNA, contain perforin and  granzyme B, and have high cytolytic activity without in vitro prestimulation. Based on both  phenotypic and functional properties, we conclude that memory- and effector-type T cells can  be separated as distinct entities within the human CD8+ T cell subset.},

  abstract = {The hallmarks of cancer comprise six biological capabilities acquired during the multistep development of human tumors. The hallmarks constitute an organizing principle for rationalizing the complexities of neoplastic disease. They include sustaining proliferative signaling, evading growth suppressors, resisting cell death, enabling replicative immortality, inducing angiogenesis, and activating invasion and metastasis. Underlying these hallmarks are genome instability, which generates the genetic diversity that expedites their acquisition, and inflammation, which fosters multiple hallmark functions. Conceptual progress in the last decade has added two emerging hallmarks of potential generality to this list—reprogramming of energy metabolism and evading immune destruction. In addition to cancer cells, tumors exhibit another dimension of complexity: they contain a repertoire of recruited, ostensibly normal cells that contribute to the acquisition of hallmark traits by creating the “tumor microenvironment.” Recognition of the widespread applicability of these concepts will increasingly affect the development of new means to treat human cancer.},

  abstract = {Rai and Binet staging systems that have been used as a standard method for evaluating the prognosis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) have some restrictions in distinguishing the early stage CLL patients that will progress rapidly. To solve this shortcoming, prognostic parameters other than staging have become important in the recent years. Intracellular upregulation of Fc mu receptor (FCMR, FAIM3/TOSO) gene in the leukemic lymphocytes of the patients with CLL may be an important parameter in predicting the progression of the disease. In this study, FCMR mRNA expression levels were evaluated in 50 CLL patients and in 50 healthy controls. FCMR mRNA expression was found to be significantly higher in CLL patients than in healthy controls. We, then, evaluated FCMR mRNA levels according to the stages of CLL. Rai stage 0, I, II cases were compared with stage III and IV, and Binet A was compared with Binet B and C according to FCMR mRNA levels. In cases with higher risks, Rai stage III, IV and Binet stage B and C, FCMR mRNA levels were also significantly higher. In addition, overexpression of the FCMR seems to be promoting the chromosomal abnormalities. As a result, we found that the mRNA levels of FCMR in the CLL patients are 23-fold higher than that of the control group and this may suggest that it can be associated with the disease progression and survival. For this reason and because of the simplicity of analyzing with Q-PCR, it can be a useful clinical parameter, after its importance has been shown in larger and multi-variate studies.},

  abstract = {Of the diverse array of putative molecular and biological functions assigned to long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), one attractive perspective in epigenetic research has been the hypothesis that lncRNAs directly interact with the proteins involved in the modulation of chromatin conformation. Indeed, epigenetic modifiers are among the most frequent protein partners of lncRNAs that have been identified to date, of which histone methyltransferases and protein members of the Polycomb Repressive Complex PRC2 have received considerable attention. This review is focused on how lncRNAs interface with epigenetic factors to shape the outcomes of crucial biological processes such as regulation of gene transcription, modulation of nuclear architecture, X inactivation in females and pre-mRNA splicing. Because of our increasing knowledge of their role in development and cellular differentiation, more research is beginning to be done into the deregulation of lncRNAs in human disorders. Focusing on cancer, we describe some key examples of disease-focused lncRNA studies. This knowledge has significantly contributed to our ever-improving understanding of how lncRNAs interact with epigenetic factors of human disease, and has also provided a plethora of much-needed novel prognostic biomarker candidates or potential therapeutic targets. Finally, current limitations and perspectives on lncRNA research are discussed here. This article is part of a discussion meeting issue ‘Frontiers in epigenetic chemical biology’.},

Thus, O-GlcNAc cycling may serve as a homeostatic mechanism linking nutrient availability to higher-order chromatin organization. In response to nutrient availability, O-GlcNAcylation is poised to influence X chromosome inactivation and genetic imprinting, as well as embryonic development. The wide range of physiological functions regulated by O-GlcNAc cycling suggests an unexplored nexus between epigenetic regulation in disease and nutrient availability.},

  abstract = {Mutation of the orphan nuclear receptor RORα results in a severe impairment of cerebellar development by unknown mechanisms. We have found that RORα activates transcription from only a subset of sites to which it binds strongly as a monomer. RORα also selectively binds as a homodimer to a direct repeat of this monomer site with a 2-bp spacing between the AGGTCA sequences (Rev-DR2 site) and is a much more potent transcriptional activator on this site than on monomer sites or other direct repeats. To better understand the transcriptional regulatory functions of RORα, we fused its C terminus to a heterologous DNA-binding domain. Mutational analysis revealed that RORα contains both transcriptional activation and transcriptional repression domains, with the repression domain being more active in some cell types. The abilities of RORα polypeptides to repress transcription correlate with their abilities to interact with the nuclear receptor corepressors N-CoR and SMRT in vitro. However, the AF2 region of RORα inhibits corepressor interaction on DNA, consistent with the lack of repression by the full-length receptor. Thus, transcriptional regulation by RORα is complex and likely to be regulated in a cell type- and target gene-specific manner.},

Here we use primary H3K27M tumor lines and isogenic CRISPR-edited controls to assess H3K27M effects in vitro and in vivo. We find that whereas H3K27me3 and H3K27me2 are normally deposited by PRC2 across broad regions, their deposition is severely reduced in H3.3K27M cells. H3K27me3 is unable to spread from large unmethylated CpG islands, while H3K27me2 can be deposited outside these PRC2 high-affinity sites but to levels corresponding to H3K27me3 deposition in wild-type cells. Our findings indicate that PRC2 recruitment and propagation on chromatin are seemingly unaffected by K27M, which mostly impairs spread of the repressive marks it catalyzes, especially H3K27me3. Genome-wide loss of H3K27me3 and me2 deposition has limited transcriptomic consequences, preferentially affecting lowly-expressed genes regulating neurogenesis. Removal of H3K27M restores H3K27me2/me3 spread, impairs cell proliferation, and completely abolishes their capacity to form tumors in mice.},

  abstract = {Activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) initiates DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in the IgH gene (Igh) to stimulate isotype class switch recombination (CSR), and widespread breaks in non-Igh (off-target) loci throughout the genome. Because the DSBs that initiate class switching occur during the G1 phase of the cell cycle, and are repaired via end joining, CSR is considered a predominantly G1 reaction. By contrast, AID-induced non-Igh DSBs are repaired by homologous recombination. Although little is known about the connection between the cell cycle and either induction or resolution of AID-mediated non-Igh DSBs, their repair by homologous recombination implicates post-G1 phases. Coordination of DNA breakage and repair during the cell cycle is critical to promote normal class switching and prevent genomic instability. To understand how AID-mediated events are regulated through the cell cycle, we have investigated G1-to-S control in AID-dependent genome-wide DSBs. We find that AID-mediated off-target DSBs, like those induced in the Igh locus, are generated during G1. These data suggest that AID-mediated DSBs can evade G1/S checkpoint activation and persist beyond G1, becoming resolved during S phase. Interestingly, DSB resolution during S phase can promote not only non-Igh break repair, but also Ig CSR.

Because the DSBs that initiate class switching occur during the G1 phase of the cell cycle, and are repaired via end joining, CSR is considered a predominantly G1 reaction. By contrast, AID-induced non-Igh DSBs are repaired by homologous recombination. Although little is known about the connection between the cell cycle and either induction or resolution of AID-mediated non-Igh DSBs, their repair by homologous recombination implicates post-G1 phases. Coordination of DNA breakage and repair during the cell cycle is critical to promote normal class switching and prevent genomic instability. To understand how AID-mediated events are regulated through the cell cycle, we have investigated G1-to-S control in AID-dependent genome-wide DSBs. We find that AID-mediated off-target DSBs, like those induced in the Igh locus, are generated during G1. These data suggest that AID-mediated DSBs can evade G1/S checkpoint activation and persist beyond G1, becoming resolved during S phase. Interestingly, DSB resolution during S phase can promote not only non-Igh break repair, but also Ig CSR. Our results reveal novel cell cycle dynamics in response to AID-initiated DSBs, and suggest that the regulation of the repair of these DSBs through the cell cycle may ensure proper class switching while preventing AID-induced genomic instability.},

Because AID has no known target-site specificity, there have been efforts to identify non-immunoglobulin AID targets. We show here that AID acts promiscuously, generating widespread DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), genomic instability and cytotoxicity in B cells with less homologous recombination ability. We demonstrate that the homologous-recombination factor XRCC2 suppressed AID-induced off-target DSBs, promoting B cell survival. Finally, we suggest that aberrations that affect human chromosome 7q36, including XRCC2, correlate with genomic instability in B cell cancers. Our findings demonstrate that AID has promiscuous genomic DSB-inducing activity, identify homologous recombination as a safeguard against off-target AID action, and have implications for genomic instability in B cell cancers.},

Here, we introduced a patient mutation into a human DLBCL cell line using CRISPR and deleted Crebbp and Ep300 in the GC B cell compartment of mice. CREBBP-mutant DLBCL clones exhibited reduced histone H3 acetylation, expressed significantly less MHCII, and grew faster than wild-type clones in s.c. and orthotopic xenograft models. Mice lacking Crebbp in GC B cells exhibited hyperproliferation of their GC compartment upon immunization, had reduced MHCII surface expression on GC cells, and developed accelerated MYC-driven lymphomas. Ep300 inactivation reproduced some, but not all, consequences of Crebbp inactivation. MHCII deficiency phenocopied the effects of CREBBP loss in spontaneous and serial transplantation models of MYC-driven lymphomagenesis, supporting the idea that the mutational inactivation of CREBBP promotes immune evasion. Indeed, the depletion of CD4+ T cells greatly facilitated the engraftment of lymphoma cells in serial transplantation models. In summary, we provide evidence that both HATs are bona fide tumor suppressors that control MHCII expression and promote tumor immune control; mutational inactivation of CREBBP, but not of EP300, has additional cell-intrinsic engraftment and growth-promoting effects.},

Furthermore, culturing B lymphocytes with Con A for 24 hr caused the cells to synthesize DNA more rapidly in response to subsequent stimulation by lipopolysaccharide, or anti-immunoglobulin antibodies. This priming effect did not appear to require either T cells or accessory cells. It was therefore concluded that Con A activates resting B lymphocytes, i.e. stimulates them to enter the cell cycle, even though it does not induce B cells to divide.},

Here, we report that lymphoma risk SNPs, especially in the non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma subtype chronic lymphocytic leukemia, are significantly enriched for co-localization with epigenetic marks of active gene regulation. These enrichments were seen in a lymphoid-specific manner for numerous ENCODE datasets, including DNase-hypersensitivity as well as multiple segmentation-defined enhancer regions. Furthermore, we identify putatively functional SNPs that are both in regulatory elements in lymphocytes and are associated with gene expression changes in blood. We developed an algorithm, UES, that uses a Monte Carlo simulation approach to calculate the enrichment of previously identified risk SNPs in various functional elements. This multiscale approach integrating multiple datasets helps disentangle the underlying biology of lymphoma, and more broadly, is generally applicable to GWAS results from other diseases as well.},

STAT6 is tightly connected to IL-4 and IL-13 signaling, and plays a key role in TH2 polarization of the immune system, as studies on knockout mice have illustrated impressively. The last 5 years have yielded many new insights into various aspects of STAT6 signaling. While the canonical view of STAT6 activation and biology remains largely unaltered, significant progress has been made in the identification of factors involved in STAT6 activity and STAT6-mediated gene regulation. About 35 different STAT6 target genes have been identified to date, many of which are involved in TH2-associated processes. This review summarizes the existing data on STAT6. Older landmark studies are discussed, as well as surprising recent additions, like hints on inactive STAT6 dimers and the discovery of novel STAT6 isoforms. There is a particular focus on molecular aspects such as modifications of STAT6 and regulation of STAT6-dependent genes, since studies on these aspects have been particularly fruitful during the last few years.},

  abstract = {TLRs are pattern recognition receptors that initiate innate immune responses. TLR9 detects microbial DNA with hypomethylated CpG motifs and in humans is preferentially expressed by IFN-α-producing plasmacytoid dendritic cells and B cells. In addition to favoring IFN-α release, TLR9 signals B cell activation, proliferation, and IgM production. Recent findings suggest that CpG DNA-TLR9 interaction plays a key role in systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis, two autoimmune disorders characterized by dysregulated production of DNA-reactive IgG. We show that CpG DNA initiates germline Cγ1, Cγ2, and Cγ3 gene transcription by activating B cells through a TLR9-mediated NF-κB-Rel-dependent innate pathway that cooperates with IL-10 through STAT proteins and IFN-responsive factors. This pathway is inhibited by chloroquine, a drug that attenuates the clinical manifestations of IgG-mediated autoimmune disorders. Germline Cγ gene transcription is associated with up-regulation of activation-induced cytidine deaminase, a key element of the B cell class switch-inducing machinery, and is followed by class switch DNA recombination from Cμ to Cγ1, Cγ2, and Cγ3. Subsequent IgG production requires additional signals from BCR and a B cell-activating factor of the TNF family (BAFF), produced by dendritic cells upon exposure to IFN-α. Our findings suggest that CpG DNA-TLR9 interaction may be important to initiate or amplify early T cell-independent IgG responses against pathogens. This implies that CpG DNA released during infections may exacerbate autoimmunity by stimulating autoreactive B cells to switch from an IgM to a more pathogenic IgG isotype.},

  abstract = {In eukaryotes, gene expression is controlled by short regulatory DNA sequences called enhancers. Understanding how an enhancer selects its target promoter(s) is a major challenge in the field of gene regulation. Advances in genomic technologies have enabled rapid and comprehensive identification of active promoters and enhancers for many cell types. However, there is a lack of methods to link bona fide enhancers and their target promoters. Here, we develop and integrate multiple genomic features into a statistical predictor for enhancer–promoter interactions. Systematic analyses of the predicted interactions across 12 cell types reveals several global features of enhancer–promoter communication. Our approach presents a systematic and effective strategy to decipher the mechanisms underlying enhancer and promoter communication., Enhancer mapping has been greatly facilitated by various genomic marks associated with it. However, little is available in our toolbox to link enhancers with their target promoters, hampering mechanistic understanding of enhancer–promoter (EP) interaction. We develop and characterize multiple genomic features for distinguishing true EP pairs from noninteracting pairs. We integrate these features into a probabilistic predictor for EP interactions. Multiple validation experiments demonstrate a significant improvement over state-of-the-art approaches. Systematic analyses of EP interactions across 12 cell types reveal several global features of EP interactions: (i) a larger fraction of EP interactions are cell type specific than enhancers; (ii) promoters controlled by multiple enhancers have higher tissue specificity, but the regulating enhancers are less conserved; (iii) cohesin plays a role in mediating tissue-specific EP interactions via chromatin looping in a CTCF-independent manner. Our approach presents a systematic and effective strategy to decipher the mechanisms underlying EP communication.},

  abstract = {In contrast to normal differentiated cells, which rely primarily on mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation to generate the energy needed for cellular processes, most cancer cells instead rely on aerobic glycolysis, a phenomenon termed “the Warburg effect.” Aerobic glycolysis is an inefficient way to generate adenosine 5′-triphosphate (ATP), however, and the advantage it confers to cancer cells has been unclear. Here we propose that the metabolism of cancer cells, and indeed all proliferating cells, is adapted to facilitate the uptake and incorporation of nutrients into the biomass (e.g., nucleotides, amino acids, and lipids) needed to produce a new cell. Supporting this idea are recent studies showing that (i) several signaling pathways implicated in cell proliferation also regulate metabolic pathways that incorporate nutrients into biomass; and that (ii) certain cancer-associated mutations enable cancer cells to acquire and metabolize nutrients in a manner conducive to proliferation rather than efficient ATP production. A better understanding of the mechanistic links between cellular metabolism and growth control may ultimately lead to better treatments for human cancer.},

Here, we show that IL-10 also acts in an autocrine manner to regulate the differentiation of activated human B cells. We report that IL-10 expression is not restricted to a dedicated B-cell subset, but is induced transiently in peripheral human naïve, memory, and CD5+ B cells alike upon activation. Global transcriptome comparison of activated human B cells, secreting IL-10 or not, identified 138 differentially regulated genes, most of which were associated with differentiation into antibody-secreting cells and reflecting autocrine IL-10 signaling. We monitored the differentiation of IL-10-secreting B cells and determined the effect of IL-10-blocking antibodies against its autocrine and paracrine signaling. IL-10 signaling promoted the differentiation of activated IL-10-secreting B cells into IgM- or IgG-secreting cells, but was dispensable for IgA secretion. Our data imply that B-cell-derived IL-10 not only suppresses immune reactions via paracrine mechanisms, but can also contribute to the differentiation of IL-10-secreting B cells into IgM- and IgG-secreting plasmablasts through both autocrine and paracrine signaling.},

  abstract = {Eukaryotic gene transcription is accompanied by acetylation and methylation of nucleosomes near promoters, but the locations and roles of histone modifications elsewhere in the genome remain unclear. We determined the chromatin modification states in high resolution along 30 Mb of the human genome and found that active promoters are marked by trimethylation of Lys4 of histone H3 (H3K4), whereas enhancers are marked by monomethylation, but not trimethylation, of H3K4. We developed computational algorithms using these distinct chromatin signatures to identify new regulatory elements, predicting over 200 promoters and 400 enhancers within the 30-Mb region. This approach accurately predicted the location and function of independently identified regulatory elements with high sensitivity and specificity and uncovered a novel functional enhancer for the carnitine transporter SLC22A5 (OCTN2). Our results give insight into the connections between chromatin modifications and transcriptional regulatory activity and provide a new tool for the functional annotation of the human genome.},

  abstract = {The human body is composed of diverse cell types with distinct functions. Although it is known that lineage specification depends on cell-specific gene expression, which in turn is driven by promoters, enhancers, insulators and other cis-regulatory DNA sequences for each gene, the relative roles of these regulatory elements in this process are not clear. We have previously developed a chromatin-immunoprecipitation-based microarray method (ChIP-chip) to locate promoters, enhancers and insulators in the human genome. Here we use the same approach to identify these elements in multiple cell types and investigate their roles in cell-type-specific gene expression. We observed that the chromatin state at promoters and CTCF-binding at insulators is largely invariant across diverse cell types. In contrast, enhancers are marked with highly cell-type-specific histone modification patterns, strongly correlate to cell-type-specific gene expression programs on a global scale, and are functionally active in a cell-type-specific manner. Our results define over 55,000 potential transcriptional enhancers in the human genome, significantly expanding the current catalogue of human enhancers and highlighting the role of these elements in cell-type-specific gene expression.},

In addition, the replacement of histones deposited during S phase by variants that can be deposited independently of replication provide the most fundamental level of chromatin differentiation. Alternative mechanisms for depositing different variants can potentially establish and maintain epigenetic states. Variants have also evolved crucial roles in chromosome segregation, transcriptional regulation, DNA repair, and other processes. Investigations into the evolution, structure, and metabolism of histone variants provide a foundation for understanding the participation of chromatin in important cellular processes and in epigenetic memory., Canonical histones can be replaced by noncanonical variants (e.g., H3 can be replaced by H3.3 at active genes). These may be critical for chromatin-based processes (e.g., transcriptional regulation) and epigenetic memory.},

  abstract = {Although activation of the B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling pathway is implicated in the pathogenesis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), its clinical impact and the molecular correlates of such response are not clearly defined. T-cell leukemia 1 (TCL1), the AKT modulator and proto-oncogene, is differentially expressed in CLL and linked to its pathogenesis based on CD5+ B-cell expansions arising in TCL1-transgenic mice. We studied here the association of TCL1 levels and its intracellular dynamics with the in vitro responses to BCR stimulation in 70 CLL cases. The growth kinetics after BCR engagement correlated strongly with the degree and timing of induced AKT phospho-activation. This signaling intensity was best predicted by TCL1 levels and the kinetics of TCL1-AKT corecruitment to BCR membrane activation complexes, which further included the kinases LYN, SYK, ZAP70, and PKC. High TCL1 levels were also strongly associated with aggressive disease features, such as advanced clinical stage, higher white blood cell counts, and shorter lymphocyte doubling time. Higher TCL1 levels independently predicted an inferior clinical outcome (ie, shorter progression-free survival, P {$<$} .001), regardless of therapy regimen, especially for ZAP70+ tumors. We propose TCL1 as a marker of the BCR-responsive CLL subset identifying poor prognostic cases where targeting BCR-associated kinases may be therapeutically useful.},

Here we identify a new long range–acting MYC enhancer controlled by NOTCH1 that is targeted by recurrent chromosomal duplications in human T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). This highly conserved regulatory element, hereby named N-Me for NOTCH MYC enhancer, is located within a broad super-enhancer region +1.47 Mb from the MYC transcription initiating site, interacts with the MYC proximal promoter and induces orientation-independent MYC expression in reporter assays. Moreover, analysis of N-Me knockout mice demonstrates a selective and essential role of this regulatory element during thymocyte development and in NOTCH1-induced T-ALL. Together these results identify N-Me as a long-range oncogenic enhancer implicated directly in the pathogenesis of human leukemia and highlight the importance of the NOTCH1-MYC regulatory axis in T cell transformation and as a therapeutic target in T-ALL.},

To reveal cell dynamics orchestrating neural maturation, we profiled human prefrontal cortex gene expression and chromatin accessibility at single-cell resolution from gestation to adulthood. Integrative analyses define the dynamic trajectories of each cell type, revealing major gene expression reconfiguration at the prenatal-to-postnatal transition in all cell types followed by continuous reconfiguration into adulthood and identifying regulatory networks guiding cellular developmental programs, states, and functions. We uncover links between expression dynamics and developmental milestones, characterize the diverse timing of when cells acquire adult-like states, and identify molecular convergence from distinct developmental origins. We further reveal cellular dynamics and their regulators implicated in neurological disorders. Finally, using this reference, we benchmark cell identities and maturation states in organoid models. Together, this captures the dynamic regulatory landscape of human cortical development.},

  abstract = {1. Osmotic shock disrupts particles of phage T2 into material containing nearly all the phage sulfur in a form precipitable by antiphage serum, and capable of specific adsorption to bacteria. It releases into solution nearly all the phage DNA in a form not precipitable by antiserum and not adsorbable to bacteria. The sulfur-containing protein of the phage particle evidently makes up a membrane that protects the phage DNA from DNase, comprises the sole or principal antigenic material, and is responsible for attachment of the virus to bacteria. 2. Adsorption of T2 to heat-killed bacteria, and heating or alternate freezing and thawing of infected cells, sensitize the DNA of the adsorbed phage to DNase. These treatments have little or no sensitizing effect on unadsorbed phage. Neither heating nor freezing and thawing releases the phage DNA from infected cells, although other cell constituents can be extracted by these methods. These facts suggest that the phage DNA forms part of an organized intracellular structure throughout the period of phage growth. 3. Adsorption of phage T2 to bacterial debris causes part of the phage DNA to appear in solution, leaving the phage sulfur attached to the debris. Another part of the phage DNA, corresponding roughly to the remaining half of the DNA of the inactivated phage, remains attached to the debris but can be separated from it by DNase. Phage T4 behaves similarly, although the two phages can be shown to attach to different combining sites. The inactivation of phage by bacterial debris is evidently accompanied by the rupture of the viral membrane. 4. Suspensions of infected cells agitated in a Waring blendor release 75 per cent of the phage sulfur and only 15 per cent of the phage phosphorus to the solution as a result of the applied shearing force. The cells remain capable of yielding phage progeny. 5. The facts stated show that most of the phage sulfur remains at the cell surface and most of the phage DNA enters the cell on infection. Whether sulfur-free material other than DNA enters the cell has not been determined. The properties of the sulfur-containing residue identify it as essentially unchanged membranes of the phage particles. All types of evidence show that the passage of phage DNA into the cell occurs in non-nutrient medium under conditions in which other known steps in viral growth do not occur. 6. The phage progeny yielded by bacteria infected with phage labeled with radioactive sulfur contain less than 1 per cent of the parental radioactivity. The progeny of phage particles labeled with radioactive phosphorus contain 30 per cent or more of the parental phosphorus. 7. Phage inactivated by dilute formaldehyde is capable of adsorbing to bacteria, but does not release its DNA to the cell. This shows that the interaction between phage and bacterium resulting in release of the phage DNA from its protective membrane depends on labile components of the phage particle. By contrast, the components of the bacterium essential to this interaction are remarkably stable. The nature of the interaction is otherwise unknown. 8. The sulfur-containing protein of resting phage particles is confined to a protective coat that is responsible for the adsorption to bacteria, and functions as an instrument for the injection of the phage DNA into the cell. This protein probably has no function in the growth of intracellular phage. The DNA has some function. Further chemical inferences should not be drawn from the experiments presented.},

Enhancers are DNA regulatory elements that are key regulators of tissue-specific gene expression. Recent studies suggest that enhancer malfunction through point mutations in either regulatory elements or factors modulating enhancer-promoter communication could be the cause of tissue-specific cancer development. In this Perspective, we will discuss recent findings in the identification of cancer-related enhancer mutations and the role of Drosophila Trr and its human homologs, the MLL3 and MLL4/COMPASS-like complexes, as enhancer histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) monomethyltransferases functioning in enhancer-promoter communication. Recent genome-wide studies in the cataloging of somatic mutations in cancer have identified mutations in intergenic sequences encoding regulatory elements—and in MLL3 and MLL4 in both hematological malignancies and solid tumors. We propose that cancer-associated mutations in MLL3 and MLL4 exert their properties through the malfunction of Trr/MLL3/MLL4-dependent enhancers.},

The fusion protein catalyzes acetylation of histone H3 lysine 27 at its target sites, leading to robust transcriptional activation of target genes from promoters and both proximal and distal enhancers. Gene activation by the targeted acetyltransferase was highly specific across the genome. In contrast to previous dCas9-based activators, the acetyltransferase activates genes from enhancer regions and with an individual guide RNA. We also show that the core p300 domain can be fused to other programmable DNA-binding proteins. These results support targeted acetylation as a causal mechanism of transactivation and provide a robust tool for manipulating gene regulation.},

Toso appeared limited to inhibition of apoptosis mediated by members of the TNF receptor family and was capable of inhibiting T cell self-killing induced by TCR activation processes that up-regulate Fas ligand. We mapped the effect of Toso to inhibition of caspase-8 processing, the most upstream caspase activity in Fas-mediated signaling, potentially through activation of cFLIP. Toso therefore serves as a novel regulator of Fas-mediated apoptosis and may act as a regulator of cell fate in T cells and other hematopoietic lineages.},

In the first 10 months of serologic screening for HTLV-I/II among blood donors in New Mexico in 1988–1989, HTLV-IIII infection was found in 27 donors. HTLV-IIII infection waspresent in 1.0\%–1.6\% ofAmerican Indian and 0.16\%–0.27\% of Hispanic donors compared with 0.009\%–0.06\% of non-Hispanic white donors. HTLV-II was identified by DNA amplification in 12 of 13 samples from Indian and Hispanic seropositive donors. Despite apparent endemic HTLV-II infection in these populations, New Mexico Tumor Registry data showed that the incidences of hairy cell leukemia, mycosis fungoides, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia were comparable among the three ethnic groups. A population with endemic HTLV-II infection has been identified, and there is no evidence of increased risk for these three malignancies in the endemic groups.},

  abstract = {Oncogenes are activated through well-known chromosomal alterations, including gene fusion, translocation and focal amplification. Recent evidence that the control of key genes depends on chromosome structures called insulated neighborhoods led us to investigate whether proto-oncogenes occur within these structures and if oncogene activation can occur via disruption of insulated neighborhood boundaries in cancer cells. We mapped insulated neighborhoods in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), and found that tumor cell genomes contain recurrent microdeletions that eliminate the boundary sites of insulated neighborhoods containing prominent T-ALL proto-oncogenes. Perturbation of such boundaries in non-malignant cells was sufficient to activate proto-oncogenes. Mutations affecting chromosome neighborhood boundaries were found in many types of cancer. Thus, oncogene activation can occur via genetic alterations that disrupt insulated neighborhoods in malignant cells.},

Recent studies suggest that gene regulatory elements and their target genes generally occur within insulated neighborhoods, which are chromosomal loop structures formed by the interaction of two DNA sites bound by the CTCF protein and occupied by the cohesin complex. We review here evidence that insulated neighborhoods provide for specific enhancer-gene interactions, are essential for both normal gene activation and repression, form a chromosome scaffold that is largely preserved throughout development, and are perturbed by genetic and epigenetic factors in disease. Insulated neighborhoods are a powerful paradigm for gene control that provides new insights into development and disease.},

Unfortunately, the effects of SMARCA4 missense mutations have remained uncertain. Here we show that SMARCA4 cancer missense mutations target conserved ATPase surfaces and disrupt the mechanochemical cycle of remodeling. We find that heterozygous expression of mutants alters the open chromatin landscape at thousands of sites across the genome. Loss of DNA accessibility does not directly overlap with Polycomb accumulation, but is enriched in “A compartments” at active enhancers, which lose H3K27ac but not H3K4me1. Affected positions include hundreds of sites identified as superenhancers in many tissues. Dominant-negative mutation induced pro-oncogenic expression changes, including increased expression of Myc and its target genes. Together, our data suggest that disruption of enhancer accessibility represents a key source of altered function in SMARCA4-mutated disorders in a wide variety of tissues.},

Although the precise cause is not well understood, the main risk factors thought to contribute to NEC include prematurity, formula feeding, and bacterial colonization. Recent evidence suggests NEC develops as a consequence of intestinal hyper-responsiveness to microbial ligands upon bacterial colonization in the preterm infant, initiating a cascade of aberrant signaling events and a robust pro-inflammatory mucosal immune response. We now have a greater understanding of important mechanisms of disease pathogenesis, such as the role of cytokines, immunoglobulins, and immune cells in NEC. In this review, we will provide an overview of the mucosal immunity of the intestine and the relationship between components of the mucosal immune system involved in the pathogenesis of NEC, while highlighting recent advances in the field that have promise as potential therapeutic targets. First, we will describe the cellular components of the intestinal epithelium and mucosal immune system and their relationship to NEC. We will then discuss the relationship between the gut microbiota and cell signaling that underpins disease pathogenesis. We will conclude our discussion by highlighting notable therapeutic advancements in NEC that target the intestinal mucosal immunity.},

Initial use of pulse methylprednisolone therapy appears to be a more efficacious and an equally safe steroid regimen when compared with regimens with lower dosage and should be considered as the preferred steroid regimen in the treatment of SARS, pending data from future randomized controlled trials.},

  abstract = {Germinal center (GC) B cells readily undergo apoptosis, a tendency which can be suppressed in vitro by immobilized anti-lg; mAb to CD40 and soluble CD23 (in synergy with IL-1α) also effect rescue of GC cells from programmed cell death. In the present study, the signals which stimulate rescued GC populations to DNA synthesis have been examined and compared to those established for the activation of follicular mantle (FM) B cells. On co-culture with anti-lg, optimal responses in FM B cells can be achieved with a combination of IL-4 and CD40 antibody; these activities also provided a modest stimulus to GC cells but, for this population, anti-lg was ineffective at augmenting the response further. Stimulations of GC B cells were enhanced, however, when performed on a support of primary fetal lung fibroblasts; a major influence of stroma was to promote, by direct cell-cell contact, the CD40-dependent survival of GC B cells. FM B cells were relatively independent of such stromal support. In marked contrast to FM cells, GC B cells were found to respond by enhanced DNA synthesis to IL-2 even when quite low concentrations of the factor were present (IC50 = 2 U/ml). Stimulation of GC cells via this pathway was augmented almost 2-fold on the inclusion of anti-lg- whereas neither fibroblasts, IL-4, nor CD40 antibody made any additional contribution to the IL-2-dependent response. The requirements found for stimulating GC cells in vitro are discussed with reference to the signals that this population may encounter in appropriate microenvironments in vivo: the variety of options apparently available could reflect changing priorities at different stages of a developing GC response.},

CD40 ligand and anti-CD40 antibodies have been used successfully to induce apoptosis in lymphoma lines both in vitro and in xenograft tumor models. Although this makes CD40 an attractive target for antitumor therapies, the response of malignant B cells to CD40 signaling is variable, and CD40 stimulation can enhance proliferation and can increase chemoresistance in some cell lines. It would therefore be useful to identify markers that predict whether a specific cell line or tumor will undergo apoptosis when stimulated with CD40 and to identify targets downstream of CD40 that affect only the apoptotic arm of CD40 signaling. We have analyzed gene expression patterns in CD40-sensitive and CD40-resistant diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) cell lines to identify signaling pathways that are involved in CD40-mediated apoptosis. CD40-resistant lines expressed pre-B-cell markers, including RAG and VPREB, whereas CD40-sensitive cells resembled mature B cells and expressed higher levels of transcripts encoding several members of the CD40 signaling pathway, including LCK and VAV. In addition, CD40-sensitive DLBCL cell lines also displayed constitutive activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and failed to undergo apoptosis when ERK phosphorylation was inhibited. In contrast, CD40-resistant lines showed no constitutive activation of ERK and no increase in ERK activity in response to CD40 stimulation. Our results suggest that constitutive activation of ERK may be required for death signaling by CD40. (Cancer Res 2006; 66(77):3550-7)},

Small RNAs modify chromatin structure and silence transcription by guiding Argonaute-containing complexes to complementary nascent RNA scaffolds and then mediating the recruitment of histone and DNA methyltransferases. In addition, recent advances suggest that chromatin-associated long non-coding RNA scaffolds also recruit chromatin-modifying complexes independently of small RNAs. These co-transcriptional silencing mechanisms form powerful RNA surveillance systems that detect and silence inappropriate transcription events, and provide a memory of these events via self-reinforcing epigenetic loops.},

Two T-ALL subtypes were identified that lacked rearrangements of known oncogenes. One subtype associated with cortical arrest, expression of cell cycle genes, and ectopic NKX2-1 or NKX2-2 expression for which rearrangements were identified. The second subtype associated with immature T~cell development and high expression of the MEF2C transcription factor as consequence of rearrangements of MEF2C, transcription factors that target MEF2C, or MEF2C-associated cofactors. We propose NKX2-1, NKX2-2, and MEF2C as T-ALL oncogenes that are activated by various rearrangements.},

We determined the cellular distribution of mouse FcμR and the functional consequences of Fcmr disruption. Surface FcμR expression was restricted to B-lineage cells, from immature B to plasma cells, except for a transient down-modulation during germinal center reactions. Fcmr ablation had no significant effect on overall B- and T-cell development, but led to a reduction of marginal zone B cells and an increase in splenic B1 B cells. Preimmune serum IgM in mutant mice was significantly elevated as were natural autoantibodies. When immunized with live attenuated pneumococci, mutant mice mounted robust antibody responses against phosphorylcholine, but not protein, determinants compared with wild-type mice. By contrast, upon immunization with a hapten-carrier conjugate, nitrophenyl-coupled chicken γ-globulin (NP-CGG), the mutant mice had a diminished primary IgG1 response to both NP and CGG. These findings suggest that FcμR has an important role in IgM homeostasis and regulation of humoral immune responses.},

As a main result, we found that the expression levels of nearly all enzymes become markedly disturbed in lymphoma, suggesting deregulation of large parts of the epigenetic machinery. We discuss the effect of DNA promoter methylation and of transcriptional activity in the context of mutated epigenetic modifiers such as EZH2 and MLL2. As another mechanism, we studied the coupling between the energy metabolism and epigenetics via metabolites that act as cofactors of JmjC-type demethylases. Our study results suggest that Burkitt’s lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell Lymphoma differ by an imbalance of repressive and poised promoters, which is governed predominantly by the activity of methyltransferases and the underrepresentation of demethylases in this regulation. The data further suggest that coupling of epigenetics with the energy metabolism can also be an important factor in lymphomagenesis in the absence of direct mutations of genes in metabolic pathways. Understanding of epigenetic deregulation in lymphoma and possibly in cancers in general must go beyond simple schemes using only a few modes of regulation.},

Its diagnosis and prognosis is a challenge due to its molecular heterogeneity and diverse regimes of biological dysfunctions, which are partly driven by epigenetic mechanisms.

Our study confirms previous results about the role of stemness genes during development and maturation of B-cells and their dysfunction in lymphoma locking in more proliferative or immune-reactive states referring to B-cell functionalities in the dark and light zone of the germinal center and also in plasma cells. These dysfunctions are governed by widespread epigenetic effects altering the promoter methylation of the involved genes, their activity status as moderated by histone modifications and also by chromatin remodeling. We identified four groups of genes showing characteristic expression and methylation signatures among Burkitt’s lymphoma, diffuse large B cell lymphoma, follicular lymphoma and multiple myeloma. These signatures are associated with epigenetic effects such as remodeling from transcriptionally inactive into active chromatin states, differential promoter methylation and the enrichment of targets of transcription factors such as EZH2 and SUZ12.},

Here we attempt to make a conservative estimate of this ‘contaminated’ literature. We found 32,755 articles reporting on research with misidentified cells, in turn cited by an estimated half a million other papers. The contamination of the literature is not decreasing over time and is anything but restricted to countries in the periphery of global science. The decades-old and often contentious attempts to stop misidentification of cell lines have proven to be insufficient. The contamination of the literature calls for a fair and reasonable notification system, warning users and readers to interpret these papers with appropriate care.},

Furthermore, retroviral gene transfer of Foxp3 converts naïve T cells toward a regulatory T cell phenotype similar to that of naturally occurring CD4+ regulatory T cells. Thus, Foxp3 is a key regulatory gene for the development of regulatory T cells.},

How these factors cooperate is not fully understood. Herein, we show that GC formation is only minimally impaired in Bcl6+/− or Bach2+/− mice, although double heterozygous Bcl6+/−Bach2+/− mice exhibit profound reduction in GC formation. Splenic B cells from Bcl6+/− Bach2+/− mice display accelerated plasmacytic differentiation and high expression of key plasma cell genes such as Prdm1, Xbp1, and CD138. Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing revealed that in B cells, BACH2 is mostly bound to genes together with its heterodimer partner MAFK. The BACH2-MAFK complex binds to sets of genes known to be involved in the GC response, 60\% of which are also targets of BCL6. Approximately 30\% of BACH2 peaks overlap with BCL6, including cis-regulatory sequences of the PRDM1 gene. BCL6 also modulates BACH2 protein stability and their protein levels are positively correlated in GC B cells. Therefore, BCL6 and BACH2 cooperate to orchestrate gene expression patterning in GC B cells through both transcriptional and biochemical mechanisms, which collectively determine the proper initiation and timing of terminal differentiation.},

  abstract = {Histone H3.3 mutation (H3F3A) occurs in 50\% of cortical pediatric high-grade gliomas. This mutation replaces glycine 34 with arginine or valine (G34R/V), impairing SETD2 activity (H3K36-specific trimethyltransferase). Consequently, reduced H3K36me3 is observed on H3.3G34V nucleosomes relative to wild-type, contributing to genomic instability and driving a distinct gene expression signature associated with tumorigenesis. However, it is not known if this differential H3K36me3 enrichment is due to H3.3G34V mutant protein alone. Therefore, we set to elucidate the effect of H3.3G34V mutant protein in pediatric glioma on H3K36me3, H3K27me3 and H3.3 enrichment in vitro. We found that the doxycycline-inducible shRNA knockdown of mutant H3F3A encoding the H3.3G34V protein resulted in loss of H3.3G34V enrichment and increased H3K36me3 enrichment throughout the genome. After knockdown, H3.3G34V enrichment was preserved at loci observed to have the greatest H3.3G34V and H3K36me3 enrichment prior to knockdown. Induced expression of mutant H3.3G34V protein in vitro was insufficient to induce genomic H3K36me3 enrichment patterns observed in H3.3G34V mutant glioma cells. We also observed strong co-enrichment of H3.3G34V and wild-type H3.3 protein, as well as greater H3K27me3 enrichment, in cells expressing H3.3G34V. Taken together, our study demonstrates the effects of H3.3G34V mutant protein on genomic H3K36me3, H3K27me3 and H3.3 enrichment patterns in isogenic cell lines.},

  abstract = {In recent years, biological research involving human cell lines has been rapidly developing in China. However, some of the cell lines are not authenticated before use. Therefore, misidentified and/or cross-contaminated cell lines are unfortunately commonplace. In this study, we present a comprehensive investigation of cross-contamination and misidentification for a panel of 278 cell lines from 28 institutes in China by using short tandem repeat profiling method. By comparing the DNA profiles with the cell bank databases of ATCC and DSMZ, a total of 46.0\% (128/278) cases with cross-contamination/misidentification were uncovered coming from 22 institutes. Notably, 73.2\% (52 out of 71) of the cell lines established by the Chinese researchers were misidentified and accounted for 40.6\% of total misidentification (52/128). Further, 67.3\% (35/52) of the misidentified cell lines established in laboratories of China were HeLa cells or a possible hybrid of HeLa with another kind of cell line. Furthermore, the bile duct cancer cell line HCCC-9810 and degenerative lung cancer Calu-6 exhibited 88.9\% match in the ATCC database (9-loci), indicating that they were from the same origin. However, when we used 21-loci to compare these two cell lines with the same algorithm, the percent match was only 48.2\%, indicating that these two cell lines were different. The SNP profiles of HCCC-9810 and Calu-6 also revealed that they were different cell lines. 150 cell lines with unique profiles demonstrated a wide range of in vitro phenotypes. This panel of 150 genomically validated cancer cell lines represents a valuable resource for the cancer research community and will advance our understanding of the disease by providing a standard reference for cell lines that can be used for biological as well as preclinical studies.},

  abstract = {Objective: Application of high-throughput genomics technology to analysis the differences in lncRNA/mRNA expression profiles between the patients with diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and reactive hyperplasia of lymph node (RLN), and between different disease states of DLBCL, in order to explore the role of the aberrantly expressed lncRNAs in the pathogenesis of DLBCL. Materials and methods: Tumor tissue samples from five newly diagnosed DLBCL, 3 relapsed DLBCL patients and 4 samples of RLN were collected. Agilent Human lncRNA/mRNA Microarray (4×180K) was used to profile differentially expression of lncRNA/mRNAs. Bioinformatics methods were performed for data analysis, including screening of differentially expressed lncRNA/mRNAs, gene ontology (GO) and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis, and lncRNA/mRNA co-expression network construction. Portion of dysregulated lncRNAs from the microarray data analysis was selected for validation using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Results: (1) In patients with newly diagnosed DLBCL, compared to RLN, a total of 5,806 dysregulated lncRNAs were identified (P{$<$}0.05, FC≥2-fold). Among these, 2,650 lncRNAs were significantly upregulated, while 3,156 lncRNAs were significantly downregulated. From the mRNA expression profiling data, 5,628 differently expressed mRNAs were found (P{$<$}0.05, FC≥2-fold). Among them, 2,045 were significantly upregulated and 3,583 downregulated. The most enriched GO term and KEGG pathway annotation associated with DLBCL was cell cycle regulation. The coding and non-coding gene expression network construction showed the significantly correlation between lnc-FAM27B-22:1 and mRNAs, including CDCA7L, CEBPB, CHRDL1 and SMIM9. We speculated that lnc-FAM27B-22:1 might have a critical function in pathogenesis of DLBCL. (2) In patients with primary refractory DLBCL, compared with chemo-sensitive patients, a total of 425 dysregulated lncRNAs were identified(P{$<$}0.05, FC≥2-fold). Among these, 124 lncRNAs were significantly upregulated, while 301 lncRNAs were significantly downregulated. From the mRNA expression profiling data, 251 differently expressed mRNAs were found(P{$<$}0.05, FC≥2-fold). Among them, 90 were significantly upregulated and 106 downregulated. The most enriched GO terms targeted by dysregulated transcripts were involved in a variety of functions. KEGG pathway analysis showed that 25 pathways corresponded to dysregulated transcripts and the most enriched networks correlated with tumor were Wnt and P53 signaling pathway. (3) In patients with relapsed DLBCL, compared with newly diagnosed patients, a total of 605 dysregulated lncRNAs were identified(P{$<$}0.05, FC≥2-fold). Among these, 169 lncRNAs were significantly upregulated, while 436 lncRNAs were significantly downregulated. From the mRNA expression profiling data, 365 differently expressed mRNAs were found(P{$<$}0.05, FC≥2-fold). Among them, 201 were significantly upregulated and 164 downregulated. The most enriched GO terms targeted by dysregulated transcripts were involved in a variety of functions. KEGG pathway analysis showed that 24 pathways corresponded to dysregulated transcripts and the most enriched network correlated with tumor was JAK-STAT signaling pathway. (4) Fourteen dysregulated lncRNAs expressions were analyzed in the same sample series using qRT-PCR to validate the microarray analysis results. In all but one lncRNA, consistent trend of expression changes was observed in two methods. Conclusions: In patients with newly diagnosed DLBCL versus RLN, and between different disease states of DLBCL, the lncRNA/mRNA expression profiles were significantly altered. Differentially expressed mRNAs are involved in a number of biological functions and signaling pathways. It prompt lncRNA may play an important role in the mechanism of occurrence, drug resistance and relapse of DLBCL. The above results provide the theory basis for the further study on the role of differentially expressed lncRNA in the development of DLBCL and its potential application as the possible biomarkers of early diagnosis and prognosis.

  abstract = {Human cerebral cortex size and complexity has increased greatly during evolution. While increased progenitor diversity and enhanced proliferative potential play important roles in human neurogenesis and gray matter expansion, the mechanisms of human oligodendrogenesis and white matter expansion remain largely unknown. Here, we identify EGFR-expressing “Pre-OPCs” that originate from outer radial glial cells (oRGs) and undergo mitotic somal translocation (MST) during division. oRG-derived Pre-OPCs provide an additional source of human cortical oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) and define a lineage trajectory. We further show that human OPCs undergo consecutive symmetric divisions to exponentially increase the progenitor pool size. Additionally, we find that the OPC-enriched gene, PCDH15, mediates daughter cell repulsion and facilitates proliferation. These findings indicate properties of OPC derivation, proliferation, and dispersion important for human white matter expansion and myelination., The properties of human oligodendrocyte precursor cell derivation, proliferation, and dispersion are explored and provide insight into white matter expansion and myelination in the brain.,},

  abstract = {Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is widely considered to be a tumor of pulmonary neuroendocrine cells; however, a variant form of this disease has been described that lacks neuroendocrine features. Here, we applied domain-focused CRISPR screening to human cancer cell lines to identify the transcription factor (TF) POU2F3 (POU class 2 homeobox 3; also known as SKN-1a/OCT-11) as a powerful dependency in a subset of SCLC lines. An analysis of human SCLC specimens revealed that POU2F3 is expressed exclusively in variant SCLC tumors that lack expression of neuroendocrine markers and instead express markers of a chemosensory lineage known as tuft cells. Using chromatin- and RNA-profiling experiments, we provide evidence that POU2F3 is a master regulator of tuft cell identity in a variant form of SCLC. Moreover, we show that most SCLC tumors can be classified into one of three lineages based on the expression of POU2F3, ASCL1, or NEUROD1. Our CRISPR screens exposed other unique dependencies in POU2F3-expressing SCLC lines, including the lineage TFs SOX9 and ASCL2 and the receptor tyrosine kinase IGF1R (insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor). These data reveal POU2F3 as a cell identity determinant and a dependency in a tuft cell-like variant of SCLC, which may reflect a previously unrecognized cell of origin or a trans-differentiation event in this disease.},

However, these regions are often transcribed into long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). The recent application of next-generation sequencing to a growing number of cancer transcriptomes has indeed revealed thousands of lncRNAs whose aberrant expression is associated with different cancer types. Among the few that have been functionally characterized, several have been linked to malignant transformation. Notably, these lncRNAs have key roles in gene regulation and thus affect various aspects of cellular homeostasis, including proliferation, survival, migration or genomic stability. This review aims to summarize current knowledge of lncRNAs from the cancer perspective. It discusses the strategies that led to the identification of cancer-related lncRNAs and the methodologies and challenges involving the study of these molecules, as well as the imminent applications of these findings to the clinic.},

  abstract = {Mature IgM+ B-cell lymphomas that arise in certain ataxia telangiectasia-mutated (ATM)-deficient compound mutant mice harbor translocations that fuse V(D)J recombination-initiated IgH double-strand breaks (DSBs) on chromosome 12 to sequences downstream of c-myc on chromosome 15, generating dicentric chromosomes and c-myc amplification via a breakage-fusion-bridge mechanism. As V(D)J recombination DSBs occur in developing progenitor B cells in the bone marrow, we sought to elucidate a mechanism by which such DSBs contribute to oncogenic translocations/amplifications in mature B cells. For this purpose, we applied high-throughput genome-wide translocation sequencing to study the fate of introduced c-myc DSBs in splenic IgM+ B cells stimulated for activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID)-dependent IgH class switch recombination (CSR). We found frequent translocations of c-myc DSBs to AID-initiated DSBs in IgH switch regions in wild-type and ATM-deficient B cells. However, c-myc also translocated frequently to newly generated DSBs within a 35-Mb region downstream of IgH in ATM-deficient, but not wild-type, CSR-activated B cells. Moreover, we found such DSBs and translocations in activated B cells that did not express AID or undergo CSR. Our findings indicate that ATM deficiency leads to formation of chromosome 12 dicentrics via recombination-activating gene-initiated IgH DSBs in progenitor B cells and that these dicentrics can be propagated developmentally into mature B cells where they generate new DSBs downstream of IgH via breakage-fusion-bridge cycles. We propose that dicentrics formed by joining V(D)J recombination–associated IgH DSBs to DSBs downstream of c-myc in ATM-deficient B lineage cells similarly contribute to c-myc amplification and mature B-cell lymphomas.},

However, the clinicopathological significance of CPEB4 expression to glioma and its expression levels in glioma tissues and cell lines are unknown. The present study investigated the potential prognostic value of CPEB4 for human glioma., Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed to examine the dynamics of CPEB4 expression in glioma and nonneoplastic brain tissues, and the expression of CPEB4 in cell lines and freshly prepared tissue samples was measured using Western blotting and real-time PCR., CPEB4 was highly expressed at the mRNA and protein levels in 4 glioma cell lines and in 4 freshly prepared glioma tissues. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated that CPEB4 expression in glioma tissue was higher than that in corresponding nonneoplastic brain tissue (P{$\mkern1mu<\mkern1mu$}0.01). This high expression level was further increased in high-grade gliomas, and the CPEB4 expression level correlated with the WHO classification (r{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}0.774, P{$\mkern1mu<\mkern1mu$}0.01). Moreover, the overall survival of glioma patients displaying high CPEB4 protein expression (P{$\mkern1mu<\mkern1mu$}0.01) was clearly lower than that of those displaying low CPEB4 expression, and the high CPEB4 expression indicated a poorer survival in high-grade glioma patients (P{$\mkern1mu<\mkern1mu$}0.01)., Our study suggests that CPEB4 is significantly expressed in human glioma and that the upregulation of CPEB4 protein is significantly associated with advanced WHO grade. CPEB4 may serve as a highly sensitive prognostic indicator for glioma patients.},

  abstract = {Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been implicated in a variety of physiological and pathological processes, including cancer. In prostate cancer, prostate cancer gene expression marker 1 (PCGEM1) is an androgen-induced prostate-specific lncRNA whose overexpression is highly associated with prostate tumors. PCGEM1’s tumorigenic potential has been recently shown to be in part due to its ability to activate androgen receptor (AR). Here, we report a novel function of PCGEM1 that provides growth advantages for cancer cells by regulating tumor metabolism via c-Myc activation. PCGEM1 promotes glucose uptake for aerobic glycolysis, coupling with the pentose phosphate shunt to facilitate biosynthesis of nucleotide and lipid, and generates NADPH for redox homeostasis. We show that PCGEM1 regulates metabolism at a transcriptional level that affects multiple metabolic pathways, including glucose and glutamine metabolism, the pentose phosphate pathway, nucleotide and fatty acid biosynthesis, and the tricarboxylic acid cycle. The PCGEM1-mediated gene regulation takes place in part through AR activation, but predominantly through c-Myc activation, regardless of hormone or AR status. Significantly, PCGEM1 binds directly to target promoters, physically interacts with c-Myc, promotes chromatin recruitment of c-Myc, and enhances its transactivation activity. We also identified a c-Myc binding domain on PCGEM1 that contributes to the PCGEM1-dependent c-Myc activation and target induction. Together, our data uncover PCGEM1 as a key transcriptional regulator of central metabolic pathways in prostate cancer cells. By being a coactivator for both c-Myc and AR, PCGEM1 reprograms the androgen network and the central metabolism in a tumor-specific way, making it a promising target for therapeutic intervention.},

Heterogeneous mixtures of cells are placed in suspension and passed single file across one or more laser interrogation points. Light signals emitted from the particles are collected and correlated to entities such as cell morphology, surface and intracellular protein expression, gene expression, and cellular physiology. Based on user-defined parameters, individual cells can then be diverted from the fluid stream and collected into viable, homogeneous fractions at exceptionally high speeds and a purity that approaches 100\%. As such, the cell sorter becomes the launching point for numerous downstream studies. Flow cytometry is a cornerstone in clinical diagnostics, and cheaper, more versatile machines are finding their way into widespread and varied uses. In addition, advances in computing and optics have led to a new generation of flow cytometers capable of processing cells at orders of magnitudes faster than their predecessors, and with staggering degrees of complexity, making the cytometer a powerful discovery tool in biotechnology. This chapter will begin with a discussion of basic principles of flow cytometry and cell sorting, including a technical description of factors that contribute to the performance of these instruments. The remaining sections will then be divided into clinical- and research-based applications of flow cytometry and cell sorting, highlighting salient studies that illustrate the versatility of this indispensable technology.},

How the endogenous modulators of BMP signaling regulate the structural and functional maturation of the developing brain remains unclear. Here we show that expression of the BMP antagonist, \emph{Grem1}, marks a neuroprogenitor that gives rise to layer V and VI glutamatergic neurons in the embryonic mouse brain. Lineage tracing of \emph{Grem1}-expressing cells in the embryonic brain was examined by administration of tamoxifen to pregnant \emph{Grem1creERT Rosa26LSLTdtomato} mice at 13.5 days post coitum (dpc), followed by collection of embryos later in gestation. In addition, at 14.5 dpc, bulk mRNA seq analysis of differentially expressed transcripts between FACS sorted \emph{Grem1} positive and negative cells was performed. We also generated \emph{Emx1-cre} mediated \emph{Grem1} conditional knockout mice (\emph{Emx1-Cre;Grem1\textsuperscript{flox/flox}}) in which the \emph{Grem1} gene was deleted specifically in the dorsal telencephalon. \emph{Grem1\textsuperscript{Emx1cKO}} animals had reduced cortical thickness, especially layers V and VI and impaired motor balance and fear sensitivity compared to littermate controls.

  abstract = {We recently demonstrated that upregulation of a chemokine receptor CCR6 and its ligand CCL20 led to metastasis of advanced cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) cells, suggesting the involvement of CCL20-CCR6 interaction in initiating CTCL cell metastasis. In this study, we determined whether this interaction is functional in metastatic CTCL cells. We first demonstrated increased STAT3 expression during the progression of primary CTCL. STAT3 was spontaneously activated and mediated the transcription of CCL20 in CTCL cell lines. Next, to determine whether the transient knockdown of STAT3, CCL20, or CCR6 or treatment with neutralizing antibody against CCL20 (neutralizing CCL20 antibody) could reduce the migration ability of CTCL cells, we conducted an in vitro migration assay. All treatments reduced the nutrition-dependent migration activity of CTCL cells. Notably, treatment with neutralizing CCL20 antibody reduced the migration ability of the cells without decreasing the expression of CCL20 and CCR6. This demonstrated that the CCL20-CCR6 interaction is actually functional in metastatic CTCL cells. Finally, to examine the in vivo effect of neutralizing CCL20 antibody, we used NOD/Shi-scid IL-2γnul mice inoculated with CTCL cells. These mice were expected to die due to metastasis of CTCL cells into multiple organs. However, administration of neutralizing CCL20 antibody significantly prolonged the survival of the xenografted mice. These findings suggested that automatic activation of the STAT3/CCL20/CCR6 cascade was involved in CTCL lymphomagenesis and that disruption of CCL20-CCR6 interaction could be a key therapeutic strategy against advanced CTCL.},

  abstract = {Summary In an inducible oncogenesis model, the miR-200 family is inhibited during CSC formation but not transformation, and inhibition of miR-200b increases CSC formation. Interestingly, miR-200b directly targets Suz12, a subunit of a polycomb repressor complex (PRC2). Loss of miR-200 during CSC formation increases Suz12 expression, Suz12 binding, H3-K27 trimethylation, and Polycomb-mediated repression of the E-cadherin gene. miR-200b expression or Suz12 depletion blocks the formation and maintenance of mammospheres, and in combination with chemotherapy suppresses tumor growth and prolongs remission in mouse xenografts. Conversely, ectopic expression of Suz12 in transformed cells is sufficient to generate CSCs. The miR-200b-Suz12-cadherin pathway is important for CSC growth and invasive ability in genetically distinct breast cancer cells, and its transcriptional signature is observed in metastatic breast tumors. The interaction between miR-200 and Suz12 is highly conserved, suggesting that it represents an ancient regulatory mechanism to control the growth and function of stem cells.},

  abstract = {Background The role of BCL2 as a predictor of survival in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is controversial. DLBCL is heterogeneous, and the expression of BCL2 is variable within the two major subgroups of DLBCL, germinal center B-cell–like (GCB) and activated B-cell–like (ABC) DLBCL, as well as primary mediastinal DLBCL. Patients and Methods In this study, we investigated the correlation of BCL2 expression with survival in the two major subgroups of DLBCL, as well as the mechanisms of BCL2 expression. Results There was no significant correlation between BCL2 protein expression and overall survival within the GCB subgroup, but BCL2 expression had a significant adverse effect on overall survival within the ABC subgroup (P = .008). This correlation was also observed at the mRNA level (P {$<$} .04). The difference remained significant when the analyses were performed at different cutoff values. The t(14;18) was frequently observed in the GCB subgroup and was highly associated with BCL2 expression. Patients with ABC DLBCL did not exhibit t(14;18) but had a markedly higher frequency of chromosome 18q21 amplification, on which BCL2 resides. Thus, alternative mechanisms such as 18q21 amplification or activation of the nuclear factor-kappa B pathway, as reported previously, seem to be mainly responsible for the upregulation of BCL2 expression in the ABC subgroup. Conclusion Treating all DLBCL as a single entity ignores the mechanistic differences in BCL2 upregulation and obscures the prognostic significance of BCL2 expression. Hence, the significance of BCL2 and other biomarkers should be assessed in the context of DLBCL subgroups in future studies.},

  abstract = {For the past 25 years, it has been known that alterations in DNA methylation (DNAm) occur in cancer, including hypomethylation of oncogenes and hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes. However, most studies of cancer methylation have assumed that functionally important DNAm will occur in promoters, and that most DNAm changes in cancer occur in CpG islands. Here we show that most methylation alterations in colon cancer occur not in promoters, and also not in CpG islands, but in sequences up to 2 kb distant, which we term 'CpG island shores'. CpG island shore methylation was strongly related to gene expression, and it was highly conserved in mouse, discriminating tissue types regardless of species of origin. There was a notable overlap (45–65\%) of the locations of colon cancer–related methylation changes with those that distinguished normal tissues, with hypermethylation enriched closer to the associated CpG islands, and hypomethylation enriched further from the associated CpG island and resembling that of noncolon normal tissues. Thus, methylation changes in cancer are at sites that vary normally in tissue differentiation, consistent with the epigenetic progenitor model of cancer, which proposes that epigenetic alterations affecting tissue-specific differentiation are the predominant mechanism by which epigenetic changes cause cancer.},

For this purpose we selected 5 candidate lncRNAs (TUG1, LincRNA-p21, MALAT1, HOTAIR, and GAS5) where the first two are regulated by p53. Analyses were performed by real-time PCR using cDNA synthesized from plasma RNAs. In both disease groups differential levels of plasma lncRNAs were observed. LincRNA-p21 was the only molecule displaying significant changes in the CLL group while all remaining lncRNAs showed significant differences in the MM group. In the MM group only TUG1 showed higher levels than the healthy volunteers. In conclusion, the expression levels of the candidate lncRNA molecules display a general trend for tissue- and disease-specific expression which can provide important potential biomarkers specific to the particular disease type.

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}We show here that microRNA (miR)-150 is significantly downregulated in advanced cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL), and that this downregulation is strongly associated with tumor invasion/metastasis. Inoculation of CTCL cell lines into NOD/Shi-scid IL-2γnul mice led to CTCL cell migration to multiple organs; however, prior transfection of the cells with miR-150 substantially reduced the invasion/metastasis by directly downregulating CCR6, a specific receptor for the chemokine CCL20. We also found that IL-22 and its specific receptor subunit, IL22RA1, were aberrantly overexpressed in advanced CTCL, and that production of IL-22 and CCL20 was increased in cultured CTCL cells. IL22RA1 knockdown specifically reduced CCL20 production in CTCL cells, suggesting IL-22 upregulation may activate production of CCL20 and its binding to CCR6, thereby enhancing the multidirectional migration potential of CTCL cells. CTCL cells also exhibited nutrition- and CCL20-dependent chemotaxis, which were inhibited by miR-150 transfection or CCR6 knockdown. From these findings we conclude that, in the presence of continuous CCR6 upregulation accompanied by miR-150 downregulation, IL-22 activation leads to continuous CCL20-CCR6 interaction in CTCL cells and, in turn, autocrine metastasis to distal organs. This suggests miR-150, CCL20, and CCR6 could be key targets for the treatment of advanced CTCL.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

To delineate genome-wide lncRNA expression, we curated 7,256 RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) libraries from tumors, normal tissues and cell lines comprising over 43 Tb of sequence from 25 independent studies. We applied ab initio assembly methodology to this data set, yielding a consensus human transcriptome of 91,013 expressed genes. Over 68\% (58,648) of genes were classified as lncRNAs, of which 79\% were previously unannotated. About 1\% (597) of the lncRNAs harbored ultraconserved elements, and 7\% (3,900) overlapped disease-associated SNPs. To prioritize lineage-specific, disease-associated lncRNA expression, we employed non-parametric differential expression testing and nominated 7,942 lineage- or cancer-associated lncRNA genes. The lncRNA landscape characterized here may shed light on normal biology and cancer pathogenesis and may be valuable for future biomarker development.},

However, there remains little direct evidence for looping, with estimates of loop size varying widely. This has led to the suggestion that some loops, or even all of them, arise artefactually during isolation as chromatin aggregates so easily. We have now investigated the effect of isolation procedure on loop size using HeLa cells encapsulated in agarose to allow easy manipulation. Loop size in various derivatives (i.e. nuclei, nucleoids, matrices and scaffolds) critically depended on procedure; some (or all) of their loops are artefacts. The loop size in derivatives isolated using the most ?physiological? conditions was 86 kb; this remained unchanged throughout the cell cycle. This loop size is probably an average of a range of loops of between 5 and 200 kb.},

We find that these H3.3 G34 mutations directly alter the enhancer chromatin landscape of mesenchymal stem cells by impeding methylation at lysine 36 on histone H3 (H3K36) by SETD2, but not by the NSD1/2 enzymes. The reduction of H3K36 methylation by G34 mutations promotes an aberrant gain of PRC2-mediated H3K27me2/3 and loss of H3K27ac at active enhancers containing SETD2 activity. This altered histone modification profile promotes a unique gene expression profile that supports enhanced tumor development in vivo. Our findings are mirrored in G34W-containing giant cell tumors of bone where patient-derived stromal cells exhibit gene expression profiles associated with early osteoblastic differentiation. Overall, we demonstrate that H3.3 G34 oncohistones selectively promote PRC2 activity by interfering with SETD2-mediated H3K36 methylation. We propose that PRC2-mediated silencing of enhancers involved in cell differentiation represents a potential mechanism by which H3.3 G34 mutations drive these tumors.},

However, the full potential of this technique has not been realized due to limitations imposed by the components available for use in the system. These limitations include unwieldy plasmid vectors, incomplete or poorly designed two-hybrid libraries, and host strains that result in the selection of large numbers of false positives. We have used a novel multienzyme approach to generate a set of highly representative genomic libraries from S. cerevisiae. In addition, a unique host strain was created that contains three easily assayed reporter genes, each under the control of a different inducible promoter. This host strain is extremely sensitive to weak interactions and eliminates nearly all false positives using simple plate assays. Improved vectors were also constructed that simplify the construction of the gene fusions necessary for the two-hybrid system. Our analysis indicates that the libraries and host strain provide significant improvements in both the number of interacting clones identified and the efficiency of two-hybrid selections.},

Most frequently CLL transforms into diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) (90\%) and rarely (10\%) into Hodgkin lymphoma, termed Hodgkin variant of Richter syndrome (HvRS). RS is generally characterized by an aggressive clinical course and poor prognosis. In recent years, major advances have been made in understanding genetic events which relate to the progression of CLL or transformation into RS. Better understanding of the molecular pathways has revealed that RS is not a single homogeneous entity. The majority of cases are clonally related to the original CLL clone, while a minority develop from an unrelated clone. This review summarizes new data relating to the molecular biology and the genetic/epigenetic changes occurring during Richter transformation, and also considers the clinical features and therapy for both DLBCL-RS and Hodgkin variant-RS.},

  abstract = {While cancer has been long recognized as a disease of the genome, the importance of epigenetic mechanisms in neoplasia was acknowledged more recently. The most active epigenetic marks are DNA methylation and histone protein modifications and they are involved in basic biological phenomena in every cell. Their role in tumorigenesis is stressed by recent unbiased large-scale studies providing evidence that several epigenetic modifiers are recurrently mutated or frequently dysregulated in multiple cancers. The interest in epigenetic marks is especially due to the fact that they are potentially reversible and thus druggable. In B-cell progenitor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL) there is a relative paucity of reports on the role of histone protein modifications (acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation) as compared to acute myeloid leukemia, T-cell ALL, or other hematologic cancers, and in this setting chromatin modifications are relatively less well studied and reviewed than DNA methylation. In this paper, we discuss the biomarker associations and evidence for a driver role of dysregulated global and loci-specific histone marks, as well as mutations in epigenetic modifiers in BCP-ALL. Examples of chromatin modifiers recurrently mutated/disrupted in BCP-ALL and associated with disease outcomes include MLL1, CREBBP, NSD2, and SETD2. Altered histone marks and histone modifiers and readers may play a particular role in disease chemoresistance and relapse. We also suggest that epigenetic regulation of B-cell differentiation may have parallel roles in leukemogenesis.},

Via an elusive mechanism, a subpopulation of patients becomes unresponsive and/or relapses. To recapitulate various aspects of acquired resistance, rituximab-resistant (RR) clones were established from lymphoma lines and compared with parental cells. Surface CD20 expression was diminished in the clones. The clones neither responded to rituximab-mediated growth reduction or complement-dependent cytotoxicity nor underwent apoptosis in response to cross-linked rituximab. Rituximab failed to chemosensitize the RR clones, which exhibited constitutive hyperactivation of the nuclear factor-κB and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 pathways, leading to overexpression of B-cell lymphoma protein 2 (Bcl-2), Bcl-2–related gene (long alternatively spliced variant of Bcl-x gene), and myeloid cell differentiation 1 and higher drug resistance. Unlike parental cells, rituximab neither inhibited the activity of these pathways nor diminished the expression of resistant factors. Pharmacologic inhibitors of the survival pathways or Bcl-2 family members reduced the activity of these pathways, diminished antiapoptotic protein expression, and chemosensitized the RR clones. These novel in vitro results denote that continuous long-term rituximab exposure culminates in RR clones that do not respond to rituximab-mediated effects, have altered cellular signaling dynamics, and exhibit different genetic and phenotypic properties compared with parental cells. The data also reveal that although RR clones exhibit higher resistance to rituximab and cytotoxic drugs, these clones can be chemosensitized following treatment with pharmacologic inhibitors (e.g., dehydroxymethylepoxyquinomicin, bortezomib, PD098059) that target survival/antiapoptotic pathways. The findings also identify intracellular targets for potential molecular therapeutic intervention to increase treatment efficacy. The significance and potential clinical relevance of the findings are discussed. [Cancer Res 2007;67(3):1270–81]},

Although CSR correlates with epigenetic modifications at the IgH locus, the relationship between these modifications and AID remains unknown. In this study, we show that during CSR, AID forms a complex with KAP1 (KRAB domain-associated protein 1) and HP1 (heterochromatin protein 1) that is tethered to the donor switch region (Sμ) bearing H3K9me3 (trimethylated histone H3 at lysine 9) in vivo. Furthermore, in vivo disruption of this complex results in impaired AID recruitment to Sμ, inefficient DSB formation, and a concomitant defect in CSR but not in somatic hypermutation. We propose that KAP1 and HP1 tether AID to H3K9me3 residues at the donor switch region, thus providing a mechanism linking AID to epigenetic modifications during CSR.},

  abstract = {Exposure to cadmium (Cd) can cause a variety of biological effects including alterations of immune responses in animals and humans. Both immunosuppression and immunoenhancement have been reported. The present study was aimed at investigating the consequences of exposure to Cd on the human immunoglobulin (Ig) E synthesis, using purified peripheral blood B lymphocytes and IL-4 and anti-human CD40 monoclonal antibody (a-CD40 mAb) as stimuli. Low concentrations of Cd (0.1-10 microM) markedly inhibited production of IgE in a concentration-dependent manner. IgG production, in contrast to IgE, showed a tendency towards being enhanced by Cd, although with a certain individual variability; IgM production was not affected. Cd failed to alter immediate surface expression of the activation markers CD69 and CD23 indicating that early activation events were not impaired. However, the portion of activated B cells was diminished by Cd after stimulation for more than 24 h, paralleled by a concomitant decrease in viability and a subsequent reduction in proliferation. These data suggest that the mechanism of Cd action on activated B cells involved pathways that interrupted an effectively initiated cell activation and induced a cytotoxic signal. Results from this study thus provide further evidence for and new information on the immunotoxic and immunomodulatory effects of Cd on human immune responses.},

  abstract = {Global changes in the epigenome are increasingly being appreciated as key events in cancer progression. The pathogenic role of enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) has been connected to its histone 3 lysine 27 (H3K27) methyltransferase activity and gene repression; however, little is known about relationship of changes in expression of EZH2 target genes to cancer characteristics and patient prognosis. Here we show that through expression analysis of genomic regions with H3K27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) and EZH2 binding, breast cancer patients can be stratified into good and poor prognostic groups independent of known cancer gene signatures. The EZH2-bound regions were downregulated in tumors characterized by aggressive behavior, high expression of cell cycle genes, and low expression of developmental and cell adhesion genes. Depletion of EZH2 in breast cancer cells significantly increased expression of the top altered genes, decreased proliferation, and improved cell adhesion, indicating a critical role played by EZH2 in determining the cancer phenotype.},

Altered patterns of transcription in tissues and cells derived from N-CoR gene–deleted mice and the resulting block at specific points in CNS, erythrocyte, and thymocyte development indicated that N-CoR was a required component of short-term active repression by nuclear receptors and MAD and of a subset of long-term repression events mediated by REST/NRSF. Unexpectedly, N-CoR and a specific deacetylase were also required for transcriptional activation of one class of retinoic acid response element. Together, these findings suggest that specific combinations of corepressors and histone deacetylases mediate the gene-specific actions of DNA-bound repressors in development of multiple organ systems.},

  abstract = {The last few years have witnessed a rapid increase in our knowledge of the retinoid-related orphan receptors RORα, -β, and -γ (NR1F1-3), their mechanism of action, physiological functions, and their potential role in several pathologies. The characterization of ROR-deficient mice and gene expression profiling in particular have provided great insights into the critical functions of RORs in the regulation of a variety of physiological processes. These studies revealed that RORα plays a critical role in the development of the cerebellum, that both RORα and RORβ are required for the maturation of photoreceptors in the retina, and that RORγ is essential for the development of several secondary lymphoid tissues, including lymph nodes. RORs have been further implicated in the regulation of various metabolic pathways, energy homeostasis, and thymopoiesis. Recent studies identified a critical role for RORγ in lineage specification of uncommitted CD4+ T helper cells into Th17 cells. In addition, RORs regulate the expression of several components of the circadian clock and may play a role in integrating the circadian clock and the rhythmic pattern of expression of downstream (metabolic) genes. Study of ROR target genes has provided insights into the mechanisms by which RORs control these processes. Moreover, several reports have presented evidence for a potential role of RORs in several pathologies, including osteoporosis, several autoimmune diseases, asthma, cancer, and obesity, and raised the possibility that RORs may serve as potential targets for chemotherapeutic intervention. This prospect was strengthened by recent evidence showing that RORs can function as ligand-dependent transcription factors.},

In the present study, we found that a novel recurrent focal amplicon, 1q24.1-24.2, targets the MPZL1 gene in HCC. Notably, there is a positive correlation between the expression levels of MPZL1 and intrahepatic metastasis of the HCC specimens. MPZL1 can significantly enhance the migratory and metastatic potential of the HCC cells. Moreover, we found that one of the mechanisms by which MPZL1 promotes HCC cell migration is by inducing the phosphorylation and activation of the pro-metastatic protein, cortactin. Additionally, we found that Src kinase mediates the phosphorylation and activation of cortactin induced by MPZL1 overexpression. Taken together, these findings suggest that MPZL1 is a novel pro-metastatic gene targeted by a recurrent region of copy number amplification at 1q24.1-24.2 in HCC.},

Mechanistically, CREBBP-regulated enhancers are counter-regulated by the BCL6 transcriptional repressor in a complex with SMRT and HDAC3, which we found to bind extensively to MHC class II loci. HDAC3 loss-of-function rescued repression of these enhancers and corresponding genes, including MHC class II, and more profoundly suppressed CREBBP-mutant lymphomas in vitro and in vivo. Hence, CREBBP loss-of-function contributes to lymphomagenesis by enabling unopposed suppression of enhancers by BCL6/SMRT/HDAC3 complexes, suggesting HDAC3-targeted therapy as a precision approach for CREBBP-mutant lymphomas. Significance: Our findings establish the tumor suppressor function of CREBBP in GC lymphomas in which CREBBP mutations disable acetylation and result in unopposed deacetylation by BCL6/SMRT/HDAC3 complexes at enhancers of B-cell signaling and immune response genes. Hence, inhibition of HDAC3 can restore the enhancer histone acetylation and may serve as a targeted therapy for CREBBP-mutant lymphomas. Cancer Discov; 7(1); 38–53. ©2016 AACR.

The purpose of this review is to explain how alteration of different layers of the epigenome contributes to the biology and clinical features of these tumors. RECENT FINDINGS: Key new findings implicate DNA methylation heterogeneity as a core feature of DLBCL. Epigenetic diversity is linked to unfavorable clinical outcomes, clonal selection at relapse, and is driven at least in part because of the actions of activation-induced cytosine deaminase, which is a unique feature of B-cell lymphomas. Somatic mutations in histone modifier genes drive lymphomagenesis through the establishment of aberrant gene-specific histone modification signatures. For example, EZH2 somatic mutations drive silencing of bivalent gene promoters through histone 3 lysine 27 trimethylation, whereas KMT2D (MLL2) mutations disrupt specific sets of enhancers through depletion of histone 3 lysine 4 mono and dimethylation (H3K4me1/me2). SUMMARY: Appreciation of the epigenome in determining lymphoma clonal heterogeneity and in driving lymphoma phenotypes through altered promoter and enhancer histone modification profiles is leading to a paradigm shift in how we understand and design therapies for DLBCL and follicular lymphoma.},

We reprogram dual-RNA:Cas9 specificity by changing the sequence of short CRISPR RNA (crRNA) to make single- and multinucleotide changes carried on editing templates. Simultaneous use of two crRNAs enables multiplex mutagenesis. In S. pneumoniae, nearly 100\% of cells that were recovered using our approach contained the desired mutation, and in E. coli, 65\% that were recovered contained the mutation, when the approach was used in combination with recombineering. We exhaustively analyze dual-RNA:Cas9 target requirements to define the range of targetable sequences and show strategies for editing sites that do not meet these requirements, suggesting the versatility of this technique for bacterial genome engineering.},

  abstract = {Histone H3 point mutations have been identified in incurable pediatric brain cancers, but the mechanisms through which these mutations drive tumorigenesis are incompletely understood. Here, we provide evidence that RACK7 (ZMYND8) recognizes the histone H3.3 patient mutation (H3.3G34R) in vitro and in vivo. We show that RACK7 binding to H3.3G34R suppresses transcription of CIITA, which is the master regulator of MHC (major histocompatibility complex) class II molecules and genes involved in vesicular transport of MHC class II molecules to the cell surface, resulting in suppression of MHC class II molecule expression and transport. CRISPR-based knock-in correction of the H3.3G34R mutation in human pediatric glioblastoma (pGBM) cells significantly reduces overall RACK7 chromatin binding and derepresses the same set of genes as does knocking out RACK7 in the H3.3G34R pGBM cells. By demonstrating that H3.3G34R and RACK7 work together, our findings suggest a potential molecular mechanism by which H3.3G34R promotes cancer. RACK7 recognizes H3.3G34R to suppress expression of MHC II complex components and their delivery pathway in pediatric GBM.

  abstract = {A large number of cis-regulatory sequences have been annotated in the human genome, but defining their target genes remains a challenge. One strategy is to identify the long-range looping interactions at these elements with the use of chromosome conformation capture (3C)-based techniques. However, previous studies lack either the resolution or coverage to permit a whole-genome, unbiased view of chromatin interactions. Here we report a comprehensive chromatin interaction map generated in human fibroblasts using a genome-wide 3C analysis method (Hi-C). We determined over one million long-range chromatin interactions at 5–10-kb resolution, and uncovered general principles of chromatin organization at different types of genomic features. We also characterized the dynamics of promoter–enhancer contacts after TNF-α signalling in these cells. Unexpectedly, we found that TNF-α-responsive enhancers are already in contact with their target promoters before signalling. Such pre-existing chromatin looping, which also exists in other cell types with different extracellular signalling, is a strong predictor of gene induction. Our observations suggest that the three-dimensional chromatin landscape, once established in a particular cell type, is relatively stable and could influence the selection or activation of target genes by a ubiquitous transcription activator in a cell-specific manner.},

Overall, 60\% of cases had mutations in at least one component of NF-κB signaling, pointing to a central role of its genetic deregulation in OAML pathogenesis. Mutations in NOTCH1 and NOTCH2 were each found in 8\% of cases, indicating a pathogenetic function of these factors in OAML. KMT2D was identified as the first epigenetic regulator with mutations in OAML, being mutated in 22\% of cases. Mutations in MYD88 were associated with an inferior disease-free survival.

We first demonstrate how various barcode design decisions affect data quality and propose a new design that balances all considerations that we are currently aware of. We then discuss various options for the preparation of barcode sequencing libraries, including inline indices and Unique Molecular Identifiers (UMIs). Finally, we test the performance of several established and new bioinformatic pipelines for the extraction of barcodes from raw sequencing reads and for error correction. We find that both alignment and regular expression-based approaches work well for barcode extraction, and that error-correction pipelines designed specifically for barcode data are superior to generic ones.

To map these protein-DNA interactions comprehensively across entire mammalian genomes, we developed a large-scale chromatin immunoprecipitation assay (ChIPSeq) based on direct ultrahigh-throughput DNA sequencing. This sequence census method was then used to map in vivo binding of the neuron-restrictive silencer factor (NRSF; also known as REST, for repressor element–1 silencing transcription factor) to 1946 locations in the human genome. The data display sharp resolution of binding position [±50 base pairs (bp)], which facilitated our finding motifs and allowed us to identify noncanonical NRSF-binding motifs. These ChIPSeq data also have high sensitivity and specificity [ROC (receiver operator characteristic) area ≥ 0.96] and statistical confidence (P {$<$}10–4), properties that were important for inferring new candidate interactions. These include key transcription factors in the gene network that regulates pancreatic islet cell development.},

  abstract = {Glioma intratumoral heterogeneity enables adaptation to challenging microenvironments and contributes to therapeutic resistance. We integrated 914 single-cell DNA methylomes, 55,284 single-cell transcriptomes and bulk multi-omic profiles across 11 adult IDH mutant or IDH wild-type gliomas to delineate sources of intratumoral heterogeneity. We showed that local DNA methylation disorder is associated with cell–cell DNA methylation differences, is elevated in more aggressive tumors, links with transcriptional disruption and is altered during the environmental stress response. Glioma cells under in vitro hypoxic and irradiation stress increased local DNA methylation disorder and shifted cell states. We identified a positive association between genetic and epigenetic instability that was supported in bulk longitudinally collected DNA methylation data. Increased DNA methylation disorder associated with accelerated disease progression and recurrently selected DNA methylation changes were enriched for environmental stress response pathways. Our work identified an epigenetically facilitated adaptive stress response process and highlights the importance of epigenetic heterogeneity in shaping therapeutic outcomes.},

It is thought that a distinct CD4+ effector T cell subset, called T follicular helper cells (TFH), provides this help; however, the molecular requirements for TFH differentiation are unknown. We found that expression of the transcription factor Bcl6 in CD4+ T cells is both necessary and sufficient for in vivo TFH differentiation and T cell help to B cells in mice. In contrast, the transcription factor Blimp-1, an antagonist of Bcl6, inhibits TFH differentiation and help, thereby preventing B cell germinal center and antibody responses. These findings demonstrate that TFH cells are required for proper B cell responses in vivo and that Bcl6 and Blimp-1 play central but opposing roles in TFH differentiation. The transcription factors that regulate follicular T helper cell differentiation are identified. The transcription factors that regulate follicular T helper cell differentiation are identified.},

However, the regulatory roles of PRRX1 in human osteosarcoma have not been defined. In this study, we performed PRRX1 immunostaining on 35 human osteosarcoma specimens to assess the correlation between PRRX1 level and overall survival. In patients with osteosarcoma, the expression level of PRRX1 positively correlated with poor prognosis or the ratio of lung metastasis. Additionally, we found PRRX1 expression on in 143B cells, a human osteosarcoma line with a high metastatic capacity. Downregulation of PRRX1 not only suppressed proliferation and invasion but also increased the sensitivity to cisplatin and doxorubicin. When 143B cells were subcutaneously transplanted into nude mice, PRRX1 knockdown decreased tumor sizes and rates of lung metastasis. Interestingly, forskolin, a chemical compound identified by Connectivity Map analysis using RNA expression signatures during PRRX1 knockdown, decreased tumor proliferation and cell migration to the same degree as PRRX1 knockdown. These results demonstrate that PRRX1 promotes tumor malignancy in human osteosarcoma.},

To investigate the genomic changes that occur in ocular marginal zone lymphoma, we analyzed 10 cases of ocular marginal zone lymphoma using whole-genome and RNA sequencing and an additional 38 cases using targeted sequencing. Major genetic alterations affecting genes involved in nuclear factor (NF)-κB pathway activation (60\%), chromatin modification and transcriptional regulation (44\%), and B-cell differentiation (23\%) were identified. In whole-genome sequencing, the 6q23.3 region containing TNFAIP3 was deleted in 5 samples (50\%). In addition, 5 structural variation breakpoints in the first intron of IL20RA located in the 6q23.3 region was found in 3 samples (30\%). In targeted sequencing, a disruptive mutation of TNFAIP3 was the most common alteration (54\%), followed by mutations of TBL1XR1 (18\%), cAMP response element binding proteins (CREBBP) (17\%) and KMT2D (6\%). All TBL1XR1 mutations were located within the WD40 domain, and TBL1XR1 mutants transfected into 293T cells increased TBL1XR1 binding with nuclear receptor corepressor (NCoR), leading to increased degradation of NCoR and the activation of NF-κB and JUN target genes.

  abstract = {Review on the ability of different TLR agonists to orchestrate antitumor immune responses, or promote tumor growth, underscoring the impact of choosing among TLR agonists when applying these therapies in the clinic., Various TLR agonists are currently under investigation in clinical trials for their ability to orchestrate antitumor immunity. The antitumor responses are largely attributed to their aptitude to stimulate APCs such as DCs which in turn, activate tumor-specific T cell responses. However, there is a potential for TLR signaling to occur on cells other than professional APCs that could negate antitumor responses or even worse, promote tumor growth. The impetus for this review is twofold. First, there is accumulating data demonstrating that the engagement of TLRs on different T cell subsets and different cancer types could promote tumor growth or conversely, contribute to antitumor responses. Second, the efficacy of TLR agonists as monotherapies to treat cancer patients has been limited. In this review, we discuss how TLR signaling within different T cell subsets and cancer cells can potentially impact the generation of antitumor responses. Based on evidence from preclinical models and clinical trials, we draw attention to several criteria that we believe must be considered when selecting TLR agonists for developing effective immunotherapeutic strategies against cancer.},

Complementary chemically synthesized oligodeoxynucleotides that contain a recognition site for a sequence-specific DNA binding protein are annealed and ligated to give oligomers. This DNA is then covalently coupled to Sepharose CL-2B with cyanogen bromide to yield the affinity resin. A partially purified protein fraction is combined with competitor DNA and subsequently passed through the DNA-Sepharose resin. The desired sequence-specific DNA binding protein is purified because it preferentially binds to the recognition sites in the affinity resin rather than to the nonspecific competitor DNA in solution. For example, a protein fraction that is enriched for transcription factor Sp1 can be further purified 500- to 1000-fold by two sequential affinity chromatography steps to give Sp1 of an estimated 90\% homogeneity with 30\% yield. In addition, the use of tandem affinity columns containing different protein binding sites allows the simultaneous purification of multiple DNA binding proteins from the same extract. This method provides a means for the purification of rare sequence-specific DNA binding proteins, such as Sp1 and CAAT-binding transcription factor.},

Evidence is reported here that the gut microbiota regulates production of SIgA and pIgR, which act together to regulate the composition and activity of the microbiota. SIgA in the intestinal mucus layer helps to maintain spatial segregation between the microbiota and the epithelial surface without compromising the metabolic activity of the microbes. Products shed by members of the microbial community promote production of SIgA and pIgR by activating pattern recognition receptors on host epithelial and immune cells. Maternal SIgA in breast milk provides protection to newborn mammals until the developing intestinal immune system begins to produce its own SIgA. Disruption of the SIgA-pIgR-microbial triad can increase the risk of infectious, allergic andinflammatory diseases of the intestine.},

  abstract = {Summary:\enspace{} Secretory antibodies of the immunoglobulin A (IgA) class form the first line of antigen-specific immune protection against inhaled, ingested, and sexually transmitted pathogens and antigens at mucosal surfaces. Epithelial transcytosis of polymeric IgA (pIgA) is mediated by the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR). At the apical surface, the extracellular ligand-binding region of pIgR, known as secretory component (SC), is cleaved and released in free form or as a component of secretory IgA (SIgA). SC has innate anti-microbial properties, and it protects SIgA from proteolytic degradation. Expression of pIgR is regulated by microbial products through Toll-like receptor signaling and by host factors such as cytokines and hormones. Recent studies of the structure of the extracellular ligand-binding domain of pIgR have revealed mechanisms by which it binds pIgA and other ligands. During transcytosis, pIgA has been shown to neutralize pathogens and antigens within intracellular vesicular compartments. The recent identification of disease-associated polymorphisms in human pIgR near the cleavage site may help to unravel the mystery of how pIgR is cleaved to SC. The identification of novel functions for SC and SIgA has expanded our view of the immunobiology of pIgR, a key component of the mucosal immune system that bridges innate and adaptive immune defense.},

To probe the potential for IN to form protein multimers, we used the yeast two-hybrid system. The coexpression of a GAL4 DNA binding domain-IN fusion and a GAL4 activation domain-IN fusion together resulted in the successful activation of a GAL4-responsive LacZ reporter gene. The system was used to examine a variety of IN deletion mutants. The results suggest that the central region of the protein is necessary for multimerization and that the N-terminal zinc finger region is not important.},

Therefore, they have emerged as interesting targets. The effect of BET inhibitor on cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL), however, is yet to be known. Here, we examined the effect of BET inhibitor JQ1 on four cell lines (MyLa, SeAx, Hut78 and HH cells). CTCL cell lines were treated with JQ1 and cell number, cell cycle, frequency of apoptosis, and expressions of CD25, CD30 and CCR4 on the cell surface were evaluated by flow cytometry. Cell surface molecules were also analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR. JQ1 dose-dependently decreased the cell number of CTCL cells through G1 arrest concomitantly with downregulation of c-Myc expression. JQ1 induced senescence in MyLa cells and apoptosis in Hut78 and HH cells. We also showed that JQ1 inhibited tumor growth of HH cells in vivo. Moreover, JQ1 downregulated CD30 and CCR4 expression both on the cell surface and at mRNA levels. Thus, BET bromodomain inhibitor JQ1 may be useful for treatment of CTCL.},

In neurons, CPEB is detected at postsynaptic sites, as well as in the cell body. The related CPEB3 protein also regulates translation in neurons, albeit probably not through polyadenylation; it, as well as CPEB4, is present in dendrites and the cell body. Here, we show that treatment of neurons with ionotropic glutamate receptor agonists causes CPEB4 to accumulate in the nucleus. All CPEB proteins are nucleus-cytoplasm shuttling proteins that are retained in the nucleus in response to calcium-mediated signaling and alpha-calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase protein II (CaMKII) activity. CPEB2, -3, and -4 have conserved nuclear export signals that are not present in CPEB. CPEB4 is necessary for cell survival and becomes nuclear in response to focal ischemia in vivo and when cultured neurons are deprived of oxygen and glucose. Further analysis indicates that nuclear accumulation of CPEB4 is controlled by the depletion of calcium from the ER, specifically, through the inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) receptor, indicating a communication between these organelles in redistributing proteins between subcellular compartments.},

Subcellular addresses for nucleotides present in detected RNAs were assigned, and their potential processing into short RNAs was investigated. Taken together, these observations suggest a novel role for some unannotated RNAs as primary transcripts for the production of short RNAs. Three potentially functional classes of RNAs have been identified, two of which are syntenically conserved and correlate with the expression state of protein-coding genes. These data support a highly interleaved organization of the human transcriptome.

We show that Braf-rs1 and its human ortholog, BRAFP1, elicit their oncogenic activity, at least in part, as competitive endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) that elevate BRAF expression and MAPK activation in~vitro and in~vivo. Notably, we find that transcriptional or genomic aberrations of BRAFP1 occur frequently in multiple human cancers, including B cell lymphomas.

MYC expression is tightly regulated in normal lymphoid cells with high levels in the initial steps of the secondary lymphoid follicle formation and in a subset of centrocytes of the germinal center light zone. BCL6 and BLIMP1 repress MYC expression in normal germinal center B and plasma cells, respectively. Paradoxically, most lymphomas with MYC genetic alterations originate from cells that usually do not express MYC, suggesting that these tumors need to develop additional oncogenic events to overcome the MYC regulatory mechanisms and also its proapoptotic function. MYC rearrangements, and to a lesser extent gene amplifications, have been detected in approximately 5\% to 14\% of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and these alterations are frequently associated with BCL2 or BCL6 rearrangements. The concurrent presence of these alterations confers a more aggressive behavior to the tumors with poor outcome of the patients. BCL2 and MYC protein may also be coexpressed in DLBCL independently of gene alterations and this double expression also confers poor prognosis, although not as dismal as that of double genetic hits. Additional factors may modulate the biological effect of the double hit lesions because tumors in which MYC is translocated to non-IGH partner or MYC and BCL2 protein that are expressed at lower levels may have a less aggressive behavior. Further studies are needed to define the clinical implications of MYC aberrations in DLBCL and determine the most appropriate diagnostic strategy to identify these tumors.},

  abstract = {Summary An antiviral component of the human innate immune system—the APOBEC cytidine deaminases—was recently identified as a prominent source of mutations in cancers. Here, we investigated the distribution of APOBEC-induced mutations across the genomes of 119 breast and 24 lung cancer samples. While the rate of most mutations is known to be elevated in late-replicating regions that are characterized by reduced chromatin accessibility and low gene density, we observed a marked enrichment of~APOBEC mutations in early-replicating regions. This unusual mutagenesis profile may be associated with a higher propensity to form single-strand DNA substrates for APOBEC enzymes in early-replicating regions and should be accounted for in statistical analyses of cancer genome mutation catalogs aimed at understanding the mechanisms of carcinogenesis as well as highlighting genes that are significantly mutated in cancer.},

However, the mechanism underlying its putative oncogenic activity has not been established. By gene expression microarray, upon overexpression or silencing of FOXP1 in primary human B cells and DLBCL cell lines, combined with chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by next-generation sequencing, we established that FOXP1 directly represses a set of 7 proapoptotic genes. Low expression of these genes, encoding the BH3-only proteins BIK and Harakiri, the p53-regulatory proteins TP63, RASSF6, and TP53INP1, and AIM2 and EAF2, is associated with poor survival in DLBCL patients. In line with these findings, we demonstrated that FOXP1 promotes the expansion of primary mature human B cells by inhibiting caspase-dependent apoptosis, without affecting B-cell proliferation. Furthermore, FOXP1 is dependent upon, and cooperates with, NF-κB signaling to promote B-cell expansion and survival. Taken together, our data indicate that, through direct repression of proapoptotic genes, (aberrant) expression of FOXP1 complements (constitutive) NF-κB activity to promote B-cell survival and can thereby contribute to B-cell homeostasis and lymphomagenesis.},

  abstract = {Structured Abstract IntroductionPlummeting sequencing costs have led to a great increase in the number of personal genomes. Interpreting the large number of variants in them, particularly in noncoding regions, is a current challenge. This is especially the case for somatic variants in cancer genomes, a large proportion of which are noncoding. {$<$}img class="highwire-embed" alt="Embedded Image" src="https://d2ufo47lrtsv5s.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/highwire/sci/342/6154/1235587/embed/inline-graphic-1.gif"/{$>$}Prioritization of candidate noncoding cancer drivers based on patterns of selection. (Step 1) Filter somatic variants to exclude 1000 Genomes polymorphisms; (2) retain variants in noncoding annotations; (3) retain those in “sensitive” regions; (4) prioritize those disrupting a transcription-factor binding motif and (5) residing near the center of a biological network; (6) prioritize ones in annotation blocks mutated in multiple cancer samples. MethodsWe investigated patterns of selection in DNA elements from the ENCODE project using the full spectrum of variants from 1092 individuals in the 1000 Genomes Project (Phase 1), including single-nucleotide variants (SNVs), short insertions and deletions (indels), and structural variants (SVs). Although we analyzed broad functional annotations, such as all transcription-factor binding sites, we focused more on highly specific categories such as distal binding sites of factor ZNF274. The greater statistical power of the Phase 1 data set compared with earlier ones allowed us to differentiate the selective constraints on these categories. We also used connectivity information between elements from protein-protein-interaction and regulatory networks. We integrated all the information on selection to develop a workflow (FunSeq) to prioritize personal-genome variants on the basis of their deleterious impact. As a proof of principle, we experimentally validated and characterized a few candidate variants. ResultsWe identified a specific subgroup of noncoding categories with almost as much selective constraint as coding genes: “ultrasensitive” regions. We also uncovered a number of clear patterns of selection. Elements more consistently active across tissues and both maternal and paternal alleles (in terms of allele-specific activity) are under stronger selection. Variants disruptive because of mechanistic effects on transcription-factor binding (i.e. “motif-breakers”) are selected against. Higher network connectivity (i.e. for hubs) is associated with higher constraint. Additionally, many hub promoters and regulatory elements show evidence of recent positive selection. Overall, indels and SVs follow the same pattern as SNVs; however, there are notable exceptions. For instance, enhancers are enriched for SVs formed by nonallelic homologous recombination. We integrated these patterns of selection into the FunSeq prioritization workflow and applied it to cancer variants, because they present a strong contrast to inherited polymorphisms. In particular, application to \textasciitilde 90 cancer genomes (breast, prostate and medulloblastoma) reveals nearly a hundred candidate noncoding drivers. DiscussionOur approach can be readily used to prioritize variants in cancer and is immediately applicable in a precision-medicine context. It can be further improved by incorporation of larger-scale population sequencing, better annotations, and expression data from large cohorts. Identifying Important Identifiers Each of us has millions of sequence variations in our genomes. Signatures of purifying or negative selection should help identify which of those variations is functionally important. Khurana et al. (1235587) used sequence polymorphisms from 1092 humans across 14 populations to identify patterns of selection, especially in noncoding regulatory regions. Noncoding regions under very strong negative selection included binding sites of some chromatin and general transcription factors (TFs) and core motifs of some important TF families. Positive selection in TF binding sites tended to occur in network hub promoters. Many recurrent somatic cancer variants occurred in noncoding regulatory regions and thus might indicate mutations that drive cancer. Interpreting variants, especially noncoding ones, in the increasing number of personal genomes is challenging. We used patterns of polymorphisms in functionally annotated regions in 1092 humans to identify deleterious variants; then we experimentally validated candidates. We analyzed both coding and noncoding regions, with the former corroborating the latter. We found regions particularly sensitive to mutations (“ultrasensitive”) and variants that are disruptive because of mechanistic effects on transcription-factor binding (that is, “motif-breakers”). We also found variants in regions with higher network centrality tend to be deleterious. Insertions and deletions followed a similar pattern to single-nucleotide variants, with some notable exceptions (e.g., certain deletions and enhancers). On the basis of these patterns, we developed a computational tool (FunSeq), whose application to \textasciitilde 90 cancer genomes reveals nearly a hundred candidate noncoding drivers. Regions under strong selection in the human genome identify noncoding regulatory elements with possible roles in disease. Regions under strong selection in the human genome identify noncoding regulatory elements with possible roles in disease.},

  abstract = {Summary 50 years ago, Vincent Allfrey and colleagues discovered that lymphocyte activation triggers massive acetylation of chromatin. However, the molecular mechanisms driving epigenetic accessibility are still unknown. We here show that stimulated lymphocytes decondense chromatin by three differentially regulated steps. First, chromatin is repositioned away from the nuclear periphery in response to global acetylation. Second, histone nanodomain clusters decompact into mononucleosome fibers through a mechanism that requires Myc and continual energy input. Single-molecule imaging shows that this step lowers transcription factor residence time and non-specific collisions during sampling for DNA targets. Third, chromatin interactions shift from long range to predominantly short range, and CTCF-mediated loops and contact domains double in numbers. This architectural change facilitates cognate promoter-enhancer contacts and also requires Myc and continual ATP production. Our results thus define the nature and transcriptional impact of chromatin decondensation and reveal an unexpected role for Myc in the establishment of nuclear topology in mammalian cells.},

Recently, several authors have detected the HTLV-1 genome in genomic DNA from patients with CTCL and proposed a causal relation of HTLV-1 to CTCL. However, it remains controversial because these studies contain some problems in materials used to detect HTLV-1. We investigated both fresh and cultured T lymphocytes (128 specimens) derived from 50 Japanese patients with CTCL, where HTLV-1 is endemic, by using polymerase chain reaction with four sets of primers including gag, pol, env, and pX regions of HTLV-1 to elucidate the relationship between HTLV-1 and CTCL in Japan. However, none of the 128 DNA specimens revealed positive for HTLV-1 in contrast to the previous studies. We conclude that CTCL, which does not include HTLV-1, is present although the pathogenesis of CTCL may be different by areas or races. © 1997 by The American Society of Hematology.},

Mutational analysis of CTCL cells has revealed frequent amplification of the MYC oncogene, and bromodomain and extraterminal (BET) protein inhibitors have been shown to repress MYC expression in various malignancies. Towards a potential novel therapy, we thus sought to examine the effect of BET inhibition on CTCL cells in vitro. Each of the four tested BET inhibitors (JQ1, ABBV-075, I-BET762, CPI-0610) consistently induced dose-dependent decreases in viability of isolated patient-derived CTCL cells and established CTCL cell lines (MyLa, Sez4, HH, Hut78). This effect was synergistically potentiated by combination of BET inhibition with BCL2 inhibition (e.g. venetoclax) or histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibition (e.g. vorinostat or romidepsin). There was also a marked increase in caspase 3/7 activation when JQ1 was combined with either vorinostat or romidepsin, confirming that the observed synergies are due in major part to induction of apoptosis. Furthermore, MYC and BCL2 expression were each synergistically repressed when CTCL cells were treated with JQ1 plus HDAC inhibitors, suggesting cooperative activities at the level of epigenetic regulation.

  abstract = {The thalamus plays a central coordinating role in the brain. Thalamic neurons are organized into spatially distinct nuclei, but the molecular architecture of thalamic development is poorly understood, especially in humans. To begin to delineate the molecular trajectories of cell fate specification and organization in the developing human thalamus, we used single-cell and multiplexed spatial transcriptomics. We show that molecularly defined thalamic neurons differentiate in the second trimester of human development and that these neurons organize into spatially and molecularly distinct nuclei. We identified major subtypes of glutamatergic neuron subtypes that are differentially enriched in anatomically distinct nuclei and six subtypes of γ-aminobutyric acid–mediated (GABAergic) neurons that are shared and distinct across thalamic nuclei.},

  abstract = {B-cell development in the bone marrow is followed by specification into functional subsets in the spleen, including marginal zone (MZ) B-cells. MZ B-cells are classically characterized by T-independent antigenic responses and require the elaboration of distinct gene expression programs for development. Given their role in gene regulation, it is not surprising that microRNAs (miRNAs) are important factors in B-cell development. Recent work demonstrated that deficiency of the NFκB feedback regulator, miR-146a, led to a range of hematopoietic phenotypes, but B-cell phenotypes have not been extensively characterized. Here, we found that miR-146a deficient mice demonstrate a reduction in MZ B-cells, likely from a developmental block. Utilizing high-throughput sequencing and comparative analysis of developmental stage-specific transcriptomes, we determined that MZ cell differentiation was impaired due to decreases in Notch2 signaling. Our studies reveal miR-146a-dependent B-cell phenotypes, and highlight the complex role of miR-146a in the hematopoietic system.},

Their cell fate appears to be determined before Foxp3 expression; yet molecular events that prime Foxp3− Treg precursor cells are largely obscure. We found that Treg cell–specific super-enhancers (Treg-SEs), which were associated with Foxp3 and other Treg cell signature genes, began to be activated in Treg precursor cells. T cell–specific deficiency of the genome organizer Satb1 impaired Treg-SE activation and the subsequent expression of Treg signature genes, causing severe autoimmunity due to Treg cell deficiency. These results suggest that Satb1-dependent Treg-SE activation is crucial for Treg cell lineage specification in the thymus and that its perturbation is causative of autoimmune and other immunological diseases.},

  abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Tests that predict outcomes for patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are imprecise, especially for those with intermediate risk AML. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether genomic approaches can provide novel prognostic information for adult patients with de novo AML. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Whole-genome or exome sequencing was performed on samples obtained at disease presentation from 71 patients with AML (mean age, 50.8 years) treated with standard induction chemotherapy at a single site starting in March 2002, with follow-up through January 2015. In addition, deep digital sequencing was performed on paired diagnosis and remission samples from 50 patients (including 32 with intermediate-risk AML), approximately 30 days after successful induction therapy. Twenty-five of the 50 were from the cohort of 71 patients, and 25 were new, additional cases. EXPOSURES: Whole-genome or exome sequencing and targeted deep sequencing. Risk of identification based on genetic data. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Mutation patterns (including clearance of leukemia-associated variants after chemotherapy) and their association with event-free survival and overall survival. RESULTS: Analysis of comprehensive genomic data from the 71 patients did not improve outcome assessment over current standard-of-care metrics. In an analysis of 50 patients with both presentation and documented remission samples, 24 (48\%) had persistent leukemia-associated mutations in at least 5\% of bone marrow cells at remission. The 24 with persistent mutations had significantly reduced event-free and overall survival vs the 26 who cleared all mutations. Patients with intermediate cytogenetic risk profiles had similar findings. [table: see text]. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The detection of persistent leukemia-associated mutations in at least 5\% of bone marrow cells in day 30 remission samples was associated with a significantly increased risk of relapse, and reduced overall survival. These data suggest that this genomic approach may improve risk stratification for patients with AML.},

Recent studies have shown that {$>$}50\% of CLLs display hypermutated immunoglobulin variable region (IgV) sequences and a more favorable prognosis, suggesting that they may represent a distinct subset of CLLs which have transited through germinal centers (GCs), the physiologic site of IgV hypermutation. To further investigate the phenotype of CLLs, their cellular derivation and their relationship to normal B cells, we have analyzed their gene expression profiles using oligonucleotide-based DNA chip microarrays representative of ∼12,000 genes. The results show that CLLs display a common and characteristic gene expression profile that is largely independent of their IgV genotype. Nevertheless, a restricted number of genes ({$<$}30) have been identified whose differential expression can distinguish IgV mutated versus unmutated cases and identify them in independent panels of cases. Comparison of CLL profiles with those of purified normal B cell subpopulations indicates that the common CLL profile is more related to memory B cells than to those derived from naive B cells, CD5+ B cells, and GC centroblasts and centrocytes.

Here we report that the transcription factor IRF4 is required for the generation of plasma cells. Transgenic mice with conditional deletion of Irf4 in germinal center B cells lacked post–germinal center plasma cells and were unable to differentiate memory B cells into plasma cells. Plasma cell differentiation required IRF4 as well as the transcriptional repressor Blimp-1, which both acted 'upstream' of the transcription factor XBP-1. In addition, IRF4-deficient B cells had impaired expression of activation-induced deaminase and lacked class-switch recombination, suggesting an independent function for IRF4 in this process. These results identify IRF4 as a crucial transcriptional 'switch' in the generation of functionally competent plasma cells.},

  abstract = {We generated high-resolution maps of histone H3 lysine 9/14 acetylation (H3ac), histone H4 lysine 5/8/12/16 acetylation (H4ac), and histone H3 at lysine 4 mono-, di-, and trimethylation (H3K4me1, H3K4me2, H3K4me3, respectively) across the ENCODE regions. Studying each modification in five human cell lines including the ENCODE Consortium common cell lines GM06990 (lymphoblastoid) and HeLa-S3, as well as K562, HFL-1, and MOLT4, we identified clear patterns of histone modification profiles with respect to genomic features. H3K4me3, H3K4me2, and H3ac modifications are tightly associated with the transcriptional start sites (TSSs) of genes, while H3K4me1 and H4ac have more widespread distributions. TSSs reveal characteristic patterns of both types of modification present and the position relative to TSSs. These patterns differ between active and inactive genes and in particular the state of H3K4me3 and H3ac modifications is highly predictive of gene activity. Away from TSSs, modification sites are enriched in H3K4me1 and relatively depleted in H3K4me3 and H3ac. Comparison between cell lines identified differences in the histone modification profiles associated with transcriptional differences between the cell lines. These results provide an overview of the functional relationship among histone modifications and gene expression in human cells.},

  abstract = {Engagement of the B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) by crosslinking of the surface immunoglobulin (sIg) homodimer was studied for recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV)-mediated gene transfer into B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (B-CLL) cells. Leukemic cells obtained from 20 patients were stimulated with anti-sIg-directed antibodies and transduced with rAAV vectors coding for enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) (AAV/EGFP) or CD40L (AAV/CD40L). Transduction of B-CLL cells was enhanced after BCR engagement compared to unstimulated controls (P=0.0356). BCR crosslinking induced a significant, dose- and time-dependent upregulation of heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG), the primary receptor for AAV, on B-CLL cells (mean: 38.2 versus 1.7\%; P=0.0006). A correlation of HSPG expression after BCR crosslinking with transduction efficiency by AAV/EGFP (P=0.0153) and AAV/CD40L (P=0.0347) was observed. High expression of zeta-associated protein 70 (ZAP-70) in B-CLL cells correlated with a better transduction efficiency by AAV/EGFP (P{$<$}0.0001) and AAV/CD40L (P=0.002), respectively: 48 h after transduction of ZAP-70-positive samples, transgene expression was seen in a mean of 33.8\% (s.e.m. 3.7\%) and 28.9\% (s.e.m. 6.7\%) of cells, respectively, and could be specifically blocked by heparin, a soluble competitor of HSPG (P{$<$}0.0001). In summary, engagement of the BCR on ZAP-70 positive B-CLL cells allows efficient rAAV-mediated gene delivery.},

  abstract = {Nucleic acid cytidine deaminases of the activation-induced deaminase (AID)/APOBEC family are critical players in active and innate immune responses, playing roles as target-directed, purposeful mutators. AID specifically deaminates the host immunoglobulin (Ig) locus to evolve antibody specificity, whereas its close relative, APOBEC3G (A3G), lethally mutates the genomes of retroviral pathogens such as HIV. Understanding the basis for the target-specific action of these enzymes is essential, as mistargeting poses significant risks, potentially promoting oncogenesis (AID) or fostering drug resistance (A3G). AID prefers to deaminate cytosine in WRC (W = A/T, R = A/G) motifs, whereas A3G favors deamination of CCC motifs. This specificity is largely dictated by a single, divergent protein loop in the enzyme family that recognizes the DNA sequence. Through grafting of this substrate-recognition loop, we have created enzyme variants of A3G and AID with altered local targeting to directly evaluate the role of sequence specificity on immune function. We find that grafted loops placed in the A3G scaffold all produced efficient restriction of HIV but that foreign loops in the AID scaffold compromised hypermutation and class switch recombination. Local targeting, therefore, appears alterable for innate defense against retroviruses by A3G but important for adaptive antibody maturation catalyzed by AID. Notably, AID targeting within the Ig locus is proportionally correlated to its in vitro ability to target WRC sequences rather than non-WRC sequences. Although other mechanisms may also contribute, our results suggest that local sequence targeting by AID/APOBEC3 enzymes represents an elegant example of co-evolution of enzyme specificity with its target DNA sequence.},

  abstract = {Targeting the epigenome is a promising strategy in the treatment of advanced stage cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL). CTCL is a malignancy of mature CD4+ T-cells which initially involves the skin but may progress to involve blood and visceral organs. There is no curative treatment, and drug resistance is a common problem. A hallmark feature in the development and progression of CTCL is global dysregulation of the epigenome resulting in aberrant gene expression, increased expression of oncogenes, and silencing of tumor suppressors. Bromodomain 4 (BRD4) is a master epigenetic regulator of gene expression recently identified as a survival factor in many hematologic and solid malignancies. A member of the bromodomain and extra terminal (BET) protein family, BRD4 binds chromatin in super-enhancer regions to direct downstream gene expression through interaction with co-factors such as Mediator and p-TEFb. Recently, a small molecule specific inhibitor of BRD4, JQ1, has been investigated as an anti-tumor agent. The role of BRD4, and therefore the efficacy and mechanism of JQ1 in CTCL is not known. Our group recently reported the critical role of IL-15 signaling in the development and progression of CTCL (Mishra et al, Cancer Discovery, 2016). Utilizing CTCL-derived cell lines, patient samples, and the newly characterized IL-15 transgenic mouse model of CTCL, we describe the effects of IL-15 signaling on BRD4 expression, and demonstrate for the first time regulation of IL-15 receptor expression by BRD4. We also describe the efficacy of JQ1 as an anti-tumor agent in CTCL which acts by inducing cell cycle arrest in cell lines and preventing disease progression in IL-15 transgenic mice. IL-15 signaling through its heterotrimeric receptor is a driver of oncogenesis in CTCL. Treatment of primary CD4+ T-cells from healthy donors with IL-15 (100ng/ml) for 48 hours increases protein expression of BRD4 (Figure 1A). To evaluate the occupancy of BRD4 in regulatory regions of IL-15 receptor genes, we performed ChIP-sequencing for BRD4 binding in CD4+ T-cells from a healthy donor, fresh CTCL cells, and JQ1-treated CTCL cells. At the gene locus for IL-15Rα (Chromosome 10p14-p15), we observed increased BRD4 binding at the transcription start site. This occupancy is reversed upon treatment with JQ1, to a level comparable to that of healthy donor CD4+ T-cells. This pattern is recapitulated in regulatory regions for IL-15Rβ and IL-15Rγ loci. To determine if decreased BRD4 occupancy following JQ1 treatment results in decreased IL-15 receptors gene expression, immunoblotting was performed for each receptor subunit. Treatment of the CTCL cell line HuT78 cells, with JQ1 results in significant reduction in the expression of all three IL-15 receptor subunits compared to vehicle. IL-15Rα expression decreased 2.3-fold, IL-15Rβ by 17-fold, and IL-15Rγ by 122-fold (Figure 1A). To determine the efficacy of JQ1 as an anti-tumor agent, CTCL-derived cell lines were treated with increasing doses of JQ1 for 72 hours. Cell viability and cell cycle analysis was performed and IC50 values were calculated for each cell line. At 10µM dose, there were significant decreases in \% cell viability for all 5 cell lines (MyLa 66±2.56; HuT102 37±1.39; HuT78 30±1.86; HH 19±2.15; SeAx 36±0.79; p{$<$}0.0001 for all of the above). IC50 for MyLa is 21µM, HuT102 0.445µM, SeAx 4.45µM, HuT78 0.167µM, and HH 0.461µM. Treatment of these cell lines with JQ1 also resulted in a dose-dependent increase of cells in sub-G0 phase of the cell cycle, corresponding with increased Annexin V staining. IL-15 transgenic mice universally develop CTCL by 3-4 weeks of age. We treated these mice with 50mg/kg JQ1 (n=8) or a vehicle control (n=5) beginning at 4 weeks of age for 4 weeks. Scoring of the morphology, and severity of skin lesions histologically (Figure 1B) demonstrated a significant difference between JQ1 treated animals and controls (Figure 1C, p=0.0041), with JQ1-treated animals having milder disease. We conclude that BRD4 binding at regulatory regions enhances IL-15 receptor expression in CTCL. Increased receptor expression may augment IL-15 signaling, a known oncogenic mechanism in this malignancy. Furthermore, JQ1 reverses the effects of BRD4 on IL-15 receptor expression, results in significant cytotoxicity in cell lines, and prevents development of severe disease in a mouse model of CTCL. BRD4 therefore represents a promising therapeutic target in CTCL. {$<$}img class="highwire-fragment fragment-image" alt="Figure1" src="http://www.bloodjournal.org/content/bloodjournal/128/22/1097/F1.medium.gif" width="440" height="234"/{$>$}Download figureOpen in new tabDownload powerpoint Disclosures Porcu: Innate Pharma: Other: Investigator in a clinical trial; celgene: Other: Investigator in a clinical trial; miRagen: Other: Investigator in a clinical trial; Millenium: Other: investigator in a clinical trial.},

  abstract = {Smad4, the common partner Smad, is a key molecule in transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) family signaling. Loss of Smad4 expression is found in several types of cancer, including pancreatic cancer and colon cancer, and is related to carcinogenesis. Here we identified Smad4 binding sites in the promoter regions of over 25 500 known genes by chromatin immunoprecipitation on a microarray (ChIP-chip) in HaCaT human keratinocytes. We identified 925 significant Smad4 binding sites. Approximately half of the identified sites overlapped the binding regions of Smad2 and Smad3 (Smad2/3, receptor-regulated Smads in TGF-β signaling), while the rest of the regions appeared dominantly occupied by Smad4 even when a different identification threshold for Smad2/3 binding regions was used. Distribution analysis showed that Smad4 was found in the regions relatively distant from the transcription start sites, while Smad2/3 binding regions were more often present near the transcription start sites. Motif analysis also revealed that activator protein 1 (AP-1) sites were especially enriched in the sites common to Smad2/3 and Smad4 binding regions. In contrast, GC-rich motifs were enriched in Smad4-dominant binding regions. We further determined putative target genes of Smad4 whose expression was regulated by TGF-β. Our findings revealed some general characteristics of Smad4 binding regions, and provide resources for examining the role of Smad4 in epithelial cells and cancer pathogenesis. (Cancer Sci 2009)},

Analysis of the resulting transgenic mice shows that the human gamma-globin gene is expressed like an embryonic mouse globin gene; the human beta-globin gene is expressed (as previously shown) like an adult mouse globin gene. These results imply that the regulatory signals for tissue- and developmental stage-specific expression of the globin genes have been conserved between man and mouse but that the timing of the signals has changed. Because the two genes are expressed differently, we introduced a hybrid gamma beta-globin gene construct. The combination of the regulatory sequences resulted in the expression of the hybrid gene at all stages in all the murine erythroid tissues.},

  abstract = {The dynamic nature of gene expression enables cellular programming, homeostasis and environmental adaptation in living systems. Dissection of causal gene functions in cellular and organismal processes therefore necessitates approaches that enable spatially and temporally precise modulation of gene expression. Recently, a variety of microbial and plant-derived light-sensitive proteins have been engineered as optogenetic actuators, enabling high-precision spatiotemporal control of many cellular functions. However, versatile and robust technologies that enable optical modulation of transcription in the mammalian endogenous genome remain elusive. Here we describe the development of light-inducible transcriptional effectors (LITEs), an optogenetic two-hybrid system integrating the customizable TALE DNA-binding domain with the light-sensitive cryptochrome 2 protein and its interacting partner CIB1 from Arabidopsis thaliana. LITEs do not require additional exogenous chemical cofactors, are easily customized to target many endogenous genomic loci, and can be activated within minutes with reversibility. LITEs can be packaged into viral vectors and genetically targeted to probe specific cell populations. We have applied this system in primary mouse neurons, as well as in the brain of freely behaving mice in vivo to mediate reversible modulation of mammalian endogenous gene expression as well as targeted epigenetic chromatin modifications. The LITE system establishes a novel mode of optogenetic control of endogenous cellular processes and enables direct testing of the causal roles of genetic and epigenetic regulation in normal biological processes and disease states.},

  abstract = {Downregulation of miR26A1 has been reported in various B-cell malignancies; however, the mechanism behind its deregulation remains largely unknown. We investigated miR26A1 methylation and expression levels in a well-characterized series of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). From 450K methylation arrays, we first observed miR26A1 (cg26054057) as uniformly hypermethylated in MCL (n = 24) (all {$>$}75\%), while CLL (n = 18) showed differential methylation between prognostic subgroups. Extended analysis using pyrosequencing confirmed our findings and real-time quantitative PCR verified low miR26A1 expression in both CLL (n = 70) and MCL (n = 38) compared to normal B-cells. Notably, the level of miR26A1 methylation predicted outcome in CLL, with higher levels seen in poor-prognostic, IGHV-unmutated CLL. Since EZH2 was recently reported as a target for miR26A1, we analyzed the expression levels of both miR26A1 and EZH2 in primary CLL samples and observed an inverse correlation. By overexpression of miR26A1 in CLL and MCL cell lines, reduced EZH2 protein levels were observed using both Western blot and flow cytometry. In contrast, methyl-inhibitor treatment led to upregulated miR26A1 expression with a parallel decrease of EZH2 expression. Finally, increased levels of apoptosis were observed in miR26A1-overexpressing cell lines, further underscoring the functional relevance of miR26A1. In summary, we propose that epigenetic silencing of miR26A1 is required for the maintenance of increased levels of EZH2, which in turn translate into a worse outcome, as shown in CLL, highlighting miR26A1 as a tumor suppressor miRNA.},

  abstract = {Cell lines are essential models for biomedical research. However, they have a common and important problem that needs to be addressed. Cell lines can be misidentified, meaning that they no longer correspond to the donor from whom the cells were first obtained. This problem may arise due to cross-contamination: the accidental introduction of cells from another culture. The contaminant, which is often a rapidly dividing cell line, will overgrow and replace the original culture. The end result is a false cell line, also known as a misidentified or imposter cell line. False cell lines may come from an entirely different species, tissue, or cell type than the original donor. If undetected, false cell lines produce unreliable and irreproducible results that pollute the biomedical literature and threaten the development of reliable drug discovery and meaningful patient treatments.The goal of this study was to ascertain how widespread this problem is and how it affects the literature, as well as to estimate how much funding has been used to produce pools of scientific literature of questionable value. We focus on HEp-2 [HeLa] and Intestine 407 [HeLa], two false cell lines that are widely used in the scientific literature but were shown to be cross-contaminated in 1967. These two cell lines have been used in 8497 and 1397 published articles and extensively described as laryngeal cancer and normal intestine, respectively, rather than their true identity: the cervical cancer cell line HeLa. Discussed are tools, approaches, and resources that can address this issue-both retrospectively and prospectively.},

Typical experimental design consists in comparing two conditions with several replicates using a differential gene expression test followed by preranked GSEA performed against a collection of hundreds and thousands of pathways. However, the reference implementation of this method cannot accurately estimate small P-values, which significantly limits its sensitivity due to multiple hypotheses correction procedure. Here we present FGSEA (Fast Gene Set Enrichment Analysis) method that is able to estimate arbitrarily low GSEA P-values with a high accuracy in a matter of minutes or even seconds. To confirm the accuracy of the method, we also developed an exact algorithm for GSEA P-values calculation for integer gene-level statistics. Using the exact algorithm as a reference we show that FGSEA is able to routinely estimate P-values up to 10−100 with a small and predictable estimation error. We systematically evaluate FGSEA on a collection of 605 datasets and show that FGSEA recovers much more statistically significant pathways compared to other implementations. FGSEA is open source and available as an R package in Bioconductor (http://bioconductor.org/packages/fgsea/) and on GitHub (https://github.com/ctlab/fgsea/).},

  abstract = {Pediatric glioblastoma (pedGBM) is an extremely aggressive pediatric brain tumor, accounting for~\textasciitilde 6\% of all central nervous system neoplasms in children. Approximately half of pedGBM harbor recurrent somatic mutations in histone 3 variants or, infrequently, IDH1/2. The remaining subset of pedGBM is highly heterogeneous, and displays a variety of genomic and epigenetic features. In the current study, we aimed to further stratify an H3-/IDH-wild type (wt) pedGBM cohort assessed through genome-wide molecular profiling. As a result, we identified three molecular subtypes of these tumors, differing in their genomic and epigenetic signatures as well as in their clinical behavior. We designated these subtypes ‘pedGBM\_MYCN’ (enriched for MYCN amplification), ‘pedGBM\_RTK1’ (enriched for PDGFRA amplification) and ‘pedGBM\_RTK2’ (enriched for EGFR amplification). These molecular subtypes were associated with significantly different outcomes, i.e. pedGBM\_RTK2 tumors show a significantly longer survival time (median OS 44~months), pedGBM\_MYCN display extremely poor outcomes (median OS 14~months), and pedGBM\_RTK1 tumors harbor an intermediate prognosis. In addition, the various molecular subtypes of H3-/IDH-wt pedGBM were clearly distinguishable from their adult counterparts, underlining their biological distinctiveness. In conclusion, our study demonstrates significant molecular heterogeneity of H3-/IDH-wt pedGBM in terms of DNA methylation and cytogenetic alterations. The recognition of three molecular subtypes of H3-/IDH-wt pedGBM further revealed close correlations with biological parameters and clinical outcomes and may therefore, be predictive of response to standard treatment protocols, but could also be useful for stratification for novel, molecularly based therapies.},

  abstract = {The JmjC domain histone H3K36me2/me1 demethylase NDY1/KDM2B is overexpressed in various types of cancer. Here we show that knocking down NDY1 in a set of ten cell lines derived from a broad range of human tumors inhibited their anchorage-dependent and anchorage-independent growth by inducing senescence and/or apoptosis in some and by inhibiting G1 progression in all. We further show that the knockdown of NDY1 in mammary adenocarcinoma cell lines decreased the number, size and replating efficiency of mammospheres and downregulated the stem cell markers ALDH and CD44, while upregulating CD24. These findings combined, suggest that NDY1 is required for the self-renewal of cancer stem cells and are in agreement with additional findings showing that, tumor cells in which NDY1 was knocked down undergo differentiation and a higher number of them is required to induce mammary adenocarcinomas, upon orthotopic injection in animals. Mechanistically, NDY1 functions as a master regulator of a set of microRNAs that target several members of the polycomb complexes PRC1 and PRC2 and its knockdown results in the de-repression of these microRNAs and the downregulation of their polycomb targets. Consistent with these observations, NDY1/KDM2B is expressed at higher levels in basal-like triple negative breast cancers and its overexpression is associated with higher rates of relapse after treatment. In addition, NDY1-regulated microRNAs are downregulated in both normal and cancer mammary stem cells. Finally, in primary human breast cancer, NDY1/KDM2B expression correlates negatively with the expression of the NDY1-regulated microRNAs, and positively with the expression of their PRC targets.},

Although lymphoma gene expression diverges significantly from GC B cells, underlying mechanisms that alter the activities of corresponding regulatory elements (REs) remain elusive. Here we define the complete pathogenic circuitry of human follicular lymphoma (FL), which activates or decommissions REs from normal GC B~cells and commandeers enhancers from other lineages. Moreover, independent sets of transcription factors, whose expression was deregulated in~FL, targeted commandeered versus decommissioned REs. Our approach revealed two distinct subtypes of low-grade FL, whose pathogenic circuitries resembled GC B or activated B cells. FL-altered enhancers also were enriched for sequence variants, including somatic mutations, which disrupt transcription-factor~binding and expression of circuit-linked genes. Thus, the pathogenic regulatory circuitry of FL reveals distinct genetic and epigenetic etiologies for GC B-cell transformation.},

  abstract = {Most B-cell lymphomas arise in the germinal center (GC), where humoral immune responses evolve from potentially oncogenic cycles of mutation, proliferation, and clonal selection. Although lymphoma gene expression diverges significantly from GC B cells, underlying mechanisms that alter the activities of corresponding regulatory elements (REs) remain elusive. Here we define the complete pathogenic circuitry of human follicular lymphoma (FL), which activates or decommissions REs from normal GC B~cells and commandeers enhancers from other lineages. Moreover, independent sets of transcription factors, whose expression was deregulated in~FL, targeted commandeered versus decommissioned REs. Our approach revealed two distinct subtypes of low-grade FL, whose pathogenic circuitries resembled GC B or activated B cells. FL-altered enhancers also were enriched for sequence variants, including somatic mutations, which disrupt transcription-factor~binding and expression of circuit-linked genes. Thus, the pathogenic regulatory circuitry of FL reveals distinct genetic and epigenetic etiologies for GC B-cell transformation.},

  abstract = {Summary Lymphocyte activation is initiated by a global increase in messenger RNA synthesis. However, the mechanisms driving transcriptome amplification during the immune response are unknown. By monitoring single-stranded DNA genome wide, we show that the genome of naive cells is poised for rapid activation. In G0, ∼90\% of promoters from genes to be expressed in cycling lymphocytes are polymerase loaded but unmelted and support only basal transcription. Furthermore, the transition from abortive to productive elongation is kinetically limiting, causing polymerases to accumulate nearer to transcription start sites. Resting lymphocytes also limit the expression of the transcription factor IIH complex, including XPB and XPD helicases involved in promoter melting and open complex extension. To date, two rate-limiting steps have been shown to control global gene expression in eukaryotes: preinitiation complex assembly and polymerase pausing. Our studies identify promoter melting as a third key regulatory step and propose that this mechanism ensures a prompt lymphocyte response to invading pathogens.},

The introductory unit, Using Bioinformatics: Genetic Testing, uses bioinformatics to teach basic concepts in genetics and molecular biology, and the advanced unit, Using Bioinformatics: Genetic Research, utilizes bioinformatics to study evolution and support student research with DNA barcoding. Pre–post surveys demonstrated significant growth (n = 24) among teachers in their preparation to teach the curricula and infuse career awareness into their classes, and these gains were sustained through the end of the academic year. Introductory unit students (n = 289) showed significant gains in awareness, relevance, and self-efficacy. While these students did not show significant gains in engagement, advanced unit students (n = 41) showed gains in all four cognitive areas. Lessons learned during Bio-ITEST are explored in the context of recommendations for other programs that wish to increase student interest in STEM careers.},

  abstract = {Summary A substantial amount of organismal complexity is thought to be encoded by enhancers which specify the location, timing, and levels of gene expression. In mammals there are more enhancers than promoters which are distributed both between and within genes. Here we show that activated, intragenic enhancers frequently act as alternative tissue-specific promoters producing a class of abundant, spliced, multiexonic poly(A)+ RNAs (meRNAs) which reflect the host gene's structure. meRNAs make a substantial and unanticipated contribution to the complexity of the transcriptome, appearing as alternative isoforms of the host gene. The low protein-coding potential of meRNAs suggests that many meRNAs may be byproducts of enhancer activation or underlie as-yet-unidentified RNA-encoded functions. Distinguishing between meRNAs and mRNAs will transform our interpretation of dynamic changes in transcription both at the level of individual genes and of the genome as a whole.},

  abstract = {The cerebellar cortex is a well-studied brain structure with diverse roles in motor learning, coordination, cognition and autonomic regulation. However,~ a complete inventory of cerebellar cell types is currently~lacking. Here, using recent advances in high-throughput transcriptional profiling1–3, we molecularly define cell types across individual lobules of the adult mouse cerebellum. Purkinje neurons showed considerable regional specialization, with the greatest diversity occurring in the posterior lobules. For several types of cerebellar interneuron, the molecular variation within each type was more continuous, rather than discrete. In particular, for the unipolar brush cells—an interneuron population previously subdivided into discrete populations—the continuous variation in gene expression was associated with a graded continuum of electrophysiological properties. Notably, we found that molecular layer interneurons were composed of two molecularly and functionally distinct types. Both types show a continuum of morphological variation through the thickness of the molecular layer, but electrophysiological recordings revealed marked differences between the two types in spontaneous firing, excitability and electrical coupling. Together, these findings provide a comprehensive cellular atlas of the cerebellar cortex, and outline a methodological and conceptual framework for the integration of molecular, morphological and physiological ontologies for defining brain cell types.},

  abstract = {As with many immunopathologically driven diseases, the malignant T cells of cutaneous T-cell lymphomas (CTCLs), such as Sézary syndrome, display aberrant cytokine secretion patterns that contribute to pathology and disease progression. Targeting this disordered release of cytokines is complicated by the changing cytokine milieu that drives the phenotypic changes of CTCLs. Here, we characterize a novel signaling pathway that can be targeted to inhibit the secretion of cytokines by modulating either CXCR4 or CXCR4-mediated signaling. We demonstrate that upon ligation of the T-cell antigen receptor (TCR), the TCR associates with and transactivates CXCR4 via phosphorylation of S339-CXCR4 in order to activate a PREX1-Rac1–signaling pathway that stabilizes interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-4, and IL-10 messenger RNA (mRNA) transcripts. Pharmacologic inhibition of either TCR-CXCR4 complex formation or PREX1-Rac1 signaling in primary human T cells decreased mRNA stability and inhibited secretion of IL-2, IL-4, and IL-10. Applying this knowledge to Sézary syndrome, we demonstrate that targeting various aspects of this signaling pathway blocks both TCR-dependent and TCR-independent cytokine secretion from a Sézary syndrome–derived cell line and patient isolates. Together, these results identify multiple aspects of a novel TCR-CXCR4–signaling pathway that could be targeted to inhibit the aberrant cytokine secretion that drives the immunopathogenesis of Sézary syndrome and other immunopathological diseases.},

  abstract = {B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling plays a key role in the behavior of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). However, cellular consequences of signaling are incompletely defined. Here we explored possible links between BCR signaling and the unfolded protein response (UPR), a stress response pathway that can promote survival of normal and malignant cells. Compared with normal B cells, circulating CLL cells expressed increased, but variable, levels of UPR components. Higher expression of CHOP and XBP1 RNAs was associated with more aggressive disease. UPR activation appeared due to prior tissue-based antigenic stimulation because elevated expression of UPR components was detected within lymph node proliferation centers. Basal UPR activation also correlated closely with surface immunoglobulin M (sIgM) signaling capacity in vitro in both IGHV unmutated CLL and within mutated CLL. sIgM signaling increased UPR activation in vitro with responders showing increased expression of CHOP and XBP1 RNAs, and PERK and BIP proteins, but not XBP1 splicing. Inhibitors of BCR-associated kinases effectively prevented sIgM-induced UPR activation. Overall, this study demonstrates that sIgM signaling results in activation of some components the UPR in CLL cells. Modulation of the UPR may contribute to variable clinical behavior, and its inhibition may contribute to clinical responses to BCR-associated kinase inhibitors.},

  abstract = {CD83 is a maturation marker for dendritic cells. In the B cell lineage, CD83 is expressed especially on activated B cells and on light zone B cells during the germinal center (GC) reaction. The function of CD83 during GC responses is unclear. CD83−/− mice have a strong reduction of CD4+ T cells, which makes it difficult to analyze a functional role of CD83 on B cells during GC responses. Therefore, in the present study we generated a B cell–specific CD83 conditional knockout (CD83 B-cKO) model. CD83 B-cKO B cells show defective upregulation of MHC class II and CD86 expression and impaired proliferation after different stimuli. Analyses of GC responses after immunization with various Ags revealed a characteristic shift in dark zone and light zone B cell numbers, with an increase of B cells in the dark zone of CD83 B-cKO mice. This effect was not accompanied by alterations in the level of IgG immune responses or by major differences in affinity maturation. However, an enhanced IgE response was observed in CD83 B-cKO mice. Additionally, we observed a strong competitive disadvantage of CD83-cKO B cells in GC responses in mixed bone marrow chimeras. Furthermore, infection of mice with Borrelia burgdorferi revealed a defect in bacterial clearance of CD83 B-cKO mice with a shift toward a Th2 response, indicated by a strong increase in IgE titers. Taken together, our results show that CD83 is important for B cell activation and modulates GC composition and IgE Ab responses in vivo.},

  abstract = {It is now evident from studies of mice unable to secrete IgM that both non-immune “natural” and antigen-induced “immune” IgM are important for protection against pathogens and for regulation of immune responses to self-antigens. Since identification of its Fc receptor (FcµR) by a functional cloning strategy in 2009, the roles of FcµR in these IgM effector functions have begun to be explored. Unlike Fc receptors for switched Ig isotypes (e.g., FcγRs, FcεRs, FcαR, Fcα/µR, pIgR, FcRn), FcµR is selectively expressed by lymphocytes: B, T, and NK cells in humans and only B cells in mice. FcµR may have dual signaling ability: one through a potential as yet unidentified adaptor protein non-covalently associating with the FcµR ligand-binding chain via a His in transmembrane segment and the other through its own Tyr and Ser residues in the cytoplasmic tail. FcµR binds pentameric and hexameric IgM with a high avidity of \textasciitilde 10 nM in solution, but more efficiently binds IgM when it is attached to a membrane component via its Fab region on the same cell surface (cis engagement). Four different laboratories have generated Fcmr-ablated mice and eight different groups of investigators have examined the resultant phenotypes. There have been some clear discrepancies reported that appear to be due to factors including differences in the exons of Fcmr that were targeted to generate the knockouts. One common feature among these different mutant mice, however, is their propensity to produce autoantibodies of both IgM and IgG isotypes. In this review, we briefly describe recent findings concerning the functions of FcµR in both mice and humans and propose a model for how FcµR plays a regulatory role in B cell tolerance.},

Both pre-immune “natural” and antigen-induced “immune” IgM antibodies are important for protective immunity and for immune regulation of autoimmune processes by recognizing pathogens and self-antigens. Effector proteins interacting with the Fc portion of IgM, such as complement and complement receptors, have thus far been proposed but fail to fully account for the IgM-mediated protection and regulation. A major reason for this deficit in our understanding of IgM function seems to be lack of data on a long elusive Fc receptor for IgM (FcμR).

The two molecular subtypes of CLL have differing DNA methylomes that seem to represent epigenetic imprints from distinct normal B-cell subpopulations. DNA hypomethylation in the gene body, targeting mostly enhancer sites, was the most frequent difference between naive and memory B cells and between the two molecular subtypes of CLL and normal B cells. Although DNA methylation and gene expression were poorly correlated, we identified gene-body CpG dinucleotides whose methylation was positively or negatively associated with expression. We have also recognized a DNA methylation signature that distinguishes new clinico-biological subtypes of CLL. We propose an epigenomic scenario in which differential methylation in the gene body may have functional and clinical implications in leukemogenesis.},

  abstract = {We analyzed the DNA methylome of ten subpopulations spanning the entire B cell differentiation program by whole-genome bisulfite sequencing and high-density microarrays. We observed that non-CpG methylation disappeared upon B cell commitment, whereas CpG methylation changed extensively during B cell maturation, showing an accumulative pattern and affecting around 30\% of all measured CpG sites. Early differentiation stages mainly displayed enhancer demethylation, which was associated with upregulation of key B cell transcription factors and affected multiple genes involved in B cell biology. Late differentiation stages, in contrast, showed extensive demethylation of heterochromatin and methylation gain at Polycomb-repressed areas, and genes with apparent functional impact in B cells were not affected. This signature, which has previously been linked to aging and cancer, was particularly widespread in mature cells with an extended lifespan. Comparing B cell neoplasms with their normal counterparts, we determined that they frequently acquire methylation changes in regions already undergoing dynamic methylation during normal B cell differentiation.},

RASQUAL substantially improves fine-mapping accuracy and sensitivity relative to existing methods in RNA-seq, DNase-seq and ChIP-seq data. We illustrate how RASQUAL can be used to maximize association detection by generating the first map of chromatin accessibility QTLs (caQTLs) in a European population using ATAC-seq. Despite a modest sample size, we identified 2,707 independent caQTLs (at a false discovery rate of 10\%) and demonstrated how RASQUAL and ATAC-seq can provide powerful information for fine-mapping gene-regulatory variants and for linking distal regulatory elements with gene promoters. Our results highlight how combining between-individual and allele-specific genetic signals improves the functional interpretation of noncoding variation.},

  abstract = {Members of the Bcl-2 protein family play crucial roles in the maintenance of tissue homeostasis by regulating apoptosis in response to developmental cues or exogenous stress. Proapoptotic BH3-only members of the Bcl-2 family are essential for initiation of cell death, and they function by activating the proapoptotic Bcl-2 family members Bax and/or Bak, either directly or indirectly through binding to prosurvival Bcl-2 family members. Bax and Bak then elicit the downstream events in apoptosis signaling. Mammals have at least eight BH3-only proteins and they are activated in a stimulus-specific, as well as a cell type–specific, manner. We have generated mice lacking the BH3-only protein Bcl-2–modifying factor (Bmf) to investigate its role in cell death signaling. Our studies reveal that Bmf is dispensable for embryonic development and certain forms of stress-induced apoptosis, including loss of cell attachment (anoikis) or UV irradiation. Remarkably, loss of Bmf protected lymphocytes against apoptosis induced by glucocorticoids or histone deacetylase inhibition. Moreover, bmf−/− mice develop a B cell–restricted lymphadenopathy caused by the abnormal resistance of these cells to a range of apoptotic stimuli. Finally, Bmf-deficiency accelerated the development of γ irradiation–induced thymic lymphomas.

  abstract = {Distinct modifications of histone amino termini, such as acetylation, phosphorylation and methylation, have been proposed to underlie a chromatin-based regulatory mechanism that modulates the accessibility of genetic information. In addition to histone modifications that facilitate gene activity, it is of similar importance to restrict inappropriate gene expression if cellular and developmental programmes are to proceed unperturbed. Here we show that mammalian methyltransferases that selectively methylate histone H3 on lysine 9 (Suv39h HMTases) generate a binding site for HP1 proteins--a family of heterochromatic adaptor molecules implicated in both gene silencing and supra-nucleosomal chromatin structure. High-affinity in vitro recognition of a methylated histone H3 peptide by HP1 requires a functional chromo domain; thus, the HP1 chromo domain is a specific interaction motif for the methyl epitope on lysine9 of histone H3. In vivo, heterochromatin association of HP1 proteins is lost in Suv39h double-null primary mouse fibroblasts but is restored after the re-introduction of a catalytically active SWUV39H1 HMTase. Our data define a molecular mechanism through which the SUV39H-HP1 methylation system can contribute to the propagation of heterochromatic subdomains in native chromatin.},

Using long-read sequencing, we identify DNA variants underlying rare DMRs, including one balanced translocation, three CG-rich repeat expansions, and four copy number variants. We also identify pathogenic variants associated with episignatures.

With this method the cloned target gene can be altered by substitution, deletion or insertion of a few bases directly into a plasmid. It works by simply amplifying the whole plasmid, in a non PCR-based thermocycling reaction. During the reaction mutagenic primers, carrying the desired mutation, are integrated into the newly synthesized plasmid. In this video tutorial we demonstrate an easy and cost effective way to introduce base substitutions into a plasmid. The protocol works with standard reagents and is independent from commercial kits, which often are very expensive. Applying this protocol can reduce the total cost of a reaction to an eighth of what it costs using some of the commercial kits. In this video we also comment on critical steps during the process and give detailed instructions on how to design the mutagenic primers.},

It has been speculated that epigenetic alterations in memory lymphocytes contribute to their functional distinction from their naive counterparts. However, the nature and extent of epigenetic alterations in memory compartments remain poorly characterized. Here we profile the DNA methylome and the transcriptome of B-lymphocyte subsets representing stages of the humoral immune response before and after antigen exposure in vivo from multiple humans. A significant percentage of activation-induced losses of DNA methylation mapped to transcription factor binding sites. An additional class of demethylated loci mapped to Alu elements across the genome and accompanied repression of DNA methyltransferase 3A. The activation-dependent DNA methylation changes were largely retained in the progeny of activated B cells, generating a similar epigenetic signature in downstream memory B cells and plasma cells with distinct transcriptional programs. These findings provide insights into the methylation dynamics of the genome during cellular differentiation in an immune response.},

All TCL1 isoforms bind to the Akt pleckstrin homology domain. Both in vitro and in vivo TCL1 increases Akt kinase activity and as a consequence enhances substrate phosphorylation. In vivo, TCL1 stabilizes the mitochondrial transmembrane potential and enhances cell proliferation and survival. In vivo, TCL1 forms trimers, which associate with Akt. TCL1 facilitates the oligomerization and activation of Akt. Our data show that TCL1 is a novel Akt kinase coactivator, which promotes Akt-induced cell survival and proliferation.},

Much has been done to characterize helper T-cell subsets and their associated genome-wide epigenetic patterns. In contrast, little is known about the dynamics of histone modifications during CD4 T-cell activation and the differential kinetics of these epigenetic marks between naive and memory T cells. In this study, we have detailed the dynamics of genome-wide promoter H3K4me2 and H3K4me3 over a time course during activation of human naive and memory CD4 T cells. Our results demonstrate that changes to H3K4 methylation occur relatively late after activation (5 days) and reinforce activation-induced upregulation of gene expression, affecting multiple pathways important to T-cell activation, differentiation and function. The dynamics and mapped pathways of H3K4 methylation are distinctly different in memory cells, which have substantially more promoters marked by H3K4me3 alone, reinforcing their more differentiated state. Our study provides the first data examining genome-wide histone modification dynamics during CD4 T-cell activation, providing insight into the cross talk between H3K4 methylation and gene expression, and underscoring the impact of these marks upon key pathways integral to CD4 T-cell activation and function.},

Initially, UPR signaling aims at cytoprotection and restoration of ER homeostasis; that failing, it drives apoptotic cell death. ER stress initiates apoptosis through intracellular activation of death receptor 5 (DR5) independent of its canonical extracellular ligand Apo2L/TRAIL; however, the mechanism underlying DR5 activation is unknown. In cultured human cells, we find that misfolded proteins can directly engage with DR5 in the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment, where DR5 assembles pro-apoptotic caspase 8-activating complexes. Moreover, peptides used as a proxy for exposed misfolded protein chains selectively bind to the purified DR5 ectodomain and induce its oligomerization. These findings indicate that misfolded proteins can act as ligands to activate DR5 intracellularly and promote apoptosis. We propose that cells can use DR5 as a late protein-folding checkpoint before committing to a terminal apoptotic fate.},

  abstract = {The regulation of gene expression is mediated by interactions between chromatin and protein complexes. The importance of where and when these interactions take place in the nucleus is currently a subject of intense investigation. Increasing evidence indicates that gene activation or silencing is often associated with repositioning of the locus relative to nuclear compartments and other genomic loci. At the same time, however, structural constraints impose limits on chromatin mobility. Understanding how the dynamic nature of the positioning of genetic material in the nuclear space and the higher-order architecture of the nucleus are integrated is therefore essential to our overall understanding of gene regulation.},

  abstract = {Summary Clonal evolution is a key feature of cancer progression and relapse. We studied intratumoral heterogeneity in 149 chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cases by integrating whole-exome sequence and copy number to measure the fraction of cancer cells harboring each somatic mutation. We identified driver mutations as predominantly clonal (e.g., MYD88, trisomy 12, and del(13q)) or subclonal (e.g., SF3B1 and TP53), corresponding to earlier and later events in CLL evolution. We sampled leukemia cells from 18 patients at two time points. Ten of twelve CLL cases treated with chemotherapy (but only one of six without treatment) underwent clonal evolution, predominantly involving subclones with driver mutations (e.g., SF3B1 and TP53) that expanded over time. Furthermore, presence of a subclonal driver mutation was an independent risk factor for rapid disease progression. Our study thus uncovers patterns of clonal evolution in CLL, providing insights into its stepwise transformation, and links the presence of subclones with adverse clinical outcomes.},

  abstract = {Summary Intratumoral heterogeneity plays a critical role in tumor evolution. To define the contribution of DNA methylation to heterogeneity within tumors, we performed genome-scale bisulfite sequencing of 104 primary chronic lymphocytic leukemias (CLLs). Compared with 26 normal B cell samples, CLLs consistently displayed higher intrasample variability of DNA methylation patterns across the genome, which appears to arise from stochastically disordered methylation in malignant cells. Transcriptome analysis of bulk and single CLL cells revealed that methylation disorder was linked to low-level expression. Disordered methylation was further associated with adverse clinical outcome. We therefore propose that disordered methylation plays a similar role to that of genetic instability, enhancing the ability of cancer cells to search for superior evolutionary trajectories.},

  abstract = {We have analyzed publicly available K562 Hi-C data, which enable genome-wide unbiased capturing of chromatin interactions, using a Mixture Poisson Regression Model and a power-law decay background to define a highly specific set of interacting genomic regions. We integrated multiple ENCODE Consortium resources with the Hi-C data, using DNase-seq data and ChIP-seq data for 45 transcription factors and 9 histone modifications. We classified 12 different sets (clusters) of interacting loci that can be distinguished by their chromatin modifications and which can be categorized into two types of chromatin linkages. The different clusters of loci display very different relationships with transcription factor-binding sites. As expected, many of the transcription factors show binding patterns specific to clusters composed of interacting loci that encompass promoters or enhancers. However, cluster 9, which is distinguished by marks of open chromatin but not by active enhancer or promoter marks, was not bound by most transcription factors but was highly enriched for three transcription factors (GATA1, GATA2 and c-Jun) and three chromatin modifiers (BRG1, INI1 and SIRT6). To investigate the impact of chromatin organization on gene regulation, we performed ribonucleicacid-seq analyses before and after knockdown of GATA1 or GATA2. We found that knockdown of the GATA factors not only alters the expression of genes having a nearby bound GATA but also affects expression of genes in interacting loci. Our work, in combination with previous studies linking regulation by GATA factors with c-Jun and BRG1, provides genome-wide evidence that Hi-C data identify sets of biologically relevant interacting loci.},

Lara-Astiaso et al. studied this phenomenon in blood. They developed a technique that examines a relatively small number of cells to identify the changes that affect DNA during blood development. They found that the DNA of noncoding regions, called enhancers, is set in an open position when cells are undifferentiated and able to take on a variety of roles and gradually closes as cells mature into their final forms. Science, this issue p. 943 Chromatin modifications are crucial for development, yet little is known about their dynamics during differentiation. Hematopoiesis provides a well-defined model to study chromatin state dynamics; however, technical limitations impede profiling of homogeneous differentiation intermediates. We developed a high-sensitivity indexing-first chromatin immunoprecipitation approach to profile the dynamics of four chromatin modifications across 16 stages of hematopoietic differentiation. We identify 48,415 enhancer regions and characterize their dynamics. We find that lineage commitment involves de novo establishment of 17,035 lineage-specific enhancers. These enhancer repertoire expansions foreshadow transcriptional programs in differentiated cells. Combining our enhancer catalog with gene expression profiles, we elucidate the transcription factor network controlling chromatin dynamics and lineage specification in hematopoiesis. Together, our results provide a comprehensive model of chromatin dynamics during development. A chromatin precipitation technique identifies changes during the differentiation of blood cells.

  abstract = {Differential expression analysis of genomic data types, such as RNA-sequencing experiments, use linear models to determine the size and direction of the changes in gene expression. For RNA-sequencing, there are several established software packages for this purpose accompanied with analysis pipelines that are well described. However, there are two crucial steps in the analysis process that can be a stumbling block for many -- the set up an appropriate model via design matrices and the set up of comparisons of interest via contrast matrices. These steps are particularly troublesome because an extensive catalogue for design and contrast matrices does not currently exist. One would usually search for example case studies across different platforms and mix and match the advice from those sources to suit the dataset they have at hand. This article guides the reader through the basics of how to set up design and contrast matrices. We take a practical approach by providing code and graphical representation of each case study, starting with simpler examples (e.g. models with a single explanatory variable) and move onto more complex ones (e.g. interaction models, mixed effects models, higher order time series and cyclical models). Although our work has been written specifically with a limma -style pipeline in mind, most of it is also applicable to other software packages for differential expression analysis, and the ideas covered can be adapted to data analysis of other high-throughput technologies. Where appropriate, we explain the interpretation and differences between models to aid readers in their own model choices. Unnecessary jargon and theory is omitted where possible so that our work is accessible to a wide audience of readers, from beginners to those with experience in genomics data analysis.},

  abstract = {The DNA of each cell is wrapped around histone octamers, forming so-called ‘nucleosomal core particles’. These histone proteins have tails that project from the nucleosome and many residues in these tails can be post-translationally modified, influencing all DNA-based processes, including chromatin compaction, nucleosome dynamics, and transcription. In contrast to those present in histone tails, modifications in the core regions of the histones had remained largely uncharacterised until recently, when some of these modifications began to be analysed in detail. Overall, recent work has shown that histone core modifications can not only directly regulate transcription, but also influence processes such as DNA repair, replication, stemness, and changes in cell state. In this review, we focus on the most recent developments in our understanding of histone modifications, particularly those on the lateral surface of the nucleosome. This region is in direct contact with the DNA and is formed by the histone cores. We suggest that these lateral surface modifications represent a key insight into chromatin regulation in the cell. Therefore, lateral surface modifications form a key area of interest and a focal point of ongoing study in epigenetics.},

Incubation of the L10A cells with the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors trichostatin A (TSA) and butyrate increased expression of Blimp-1, J chain, and mad genes, decreased expression of c-myc and BSAP/Pax-5 genes, increased the expression of surface CD43 and Syndecan-1, and decreased surface IgM. Incubation of splenic B cells with TSA and dextran conjugated anti-IgD Ab increased Blimp-1 gene and Syndecan-1 surface expression. The alteration in gene expression and cell surface markers was consistent with induction of the onset of terminal B cell differentiation. Co-incubation of L10A cells with TSA and cycloheximide (CHX) abrogated the up-regulation of Blimp-1 expression, indicating that TSA-activated Blimp-1 expression required synthesis of a transcriptional activator. In contrast, mad expression was increased in L10A cells cultured with TSA and cycloheximide or cycloheximide alone, suggesting mad expression may occur independent of Blimp-1 expression and is regulated by a labile, HDAC associated transcriptional repressor. The results demonstrate that histone acetylation regulates transcription of genes controlling terminal B cell differentiation.},

Although Mel-18 has been implicated in several biological processes in cancer, its function in the EMT of human cancers has not yet been studied. Here, we demonstrate that Mel-18 negatively regulates the EMT by epigenetically modulating miR-205. We identified miR-205 as a novel target of Mel-18 using a microRNA microarray analysis and found that Mel-18 increased miR-205 transcription by the inhibition of DNA methyltransferase-mediated DNA methylation of the miR-205 promoter, thereby downregulating its target genes, ZEB1 and ZEB2. Furthermore, the loss of Mel-18 promoted ZEB1- and ZEB2-mediated downregulation of E-cadherin transcription and also enhanced the expression of mesenchymal markers, leading to increased migration and invasion in MCF-7 cells. In MDA-MB-231 cells, Mel-18 overexpression restored E-cadherin expression, resulting in reduced migration and invasion. These effects were reversed by miR-205 overexpression or inhibition. A tumor xenograft with Mel-18 knockdown MCF-7 cells consistently showed increased ZEB1 and ZEB2 expression and decreased E-cadherin expression. Taken together, these results suggest that Mel-18 functions as a tumor suppressor by its novel negative control of the EMT, achieved through regulating the expression of miR-205 and its target genes, ZEB1 and ZEB2.},

Transcription was not initiated at a fixed TSS, but from loci of 4 to 10 adjacent nucleotides. Individual TSSs had frequencies from {$<$}0.001\% to 38.5\% of the total gene-specific 5′ m7G-capped transcripts. ADRB2R used a single locus consisting of 4 adjacent TSSs. Unstimulated, the GR used a total of 358 TSSs distributed throughout 38 loci, that were principally in the 5′ UTRs and were spliced using established donor and acceptor sites. Complete demethylation of the epigenetically sensitive GR promoter with 5-azacytidine induced one new locus and 127 TSSs, 12 of which were unique. We induced GR transcription with dexamethasone and Interferon-γ, adding one new locus and 185 additional TSSs distributed throughout the promoter region. In-vitro the TSS microvariability regulated mRNA translation efficiency and the relative abundance of the different GR N-terminal protein isoform levels.},

  abstract = {Assembly of a transcriptional and post‐translational molecular interaction network in B cells, the human B‐cell interactome (HBCI), reveals a hierarchical, transcriptional control module, where MYB and FOXM1 act as synergistic master regulators of proliferation in the germinal center (GC). Eighty percent of genes jointly regulated by these transcription factors are activated in the GC, including those encoding proteins in a complex regulating DNA pre‐replication, replication, and mitosis. These results indicate that the HBCI analysis can be used for the identification of determinants of major human cell phenotypes and provides a paradigm of general applicability to normal and pathologic tissues. Visual Overview SynopsisWe have assembled an interaction network specific to human B cells (the human B‐cell interactome or HBCI), containing protein–DNA and protein–protein interactions using an evidence integration approach. The integration of different interaction layers in one network allowed us to elucidate master regulator (MR) genes controlling specific cellular processes as well as transcriptional regulation of proteins in complexes whose availability must be regulated in context‐dependent manner. The latter is a poorly understood process, as transcriptional networks and protein–protein interaction networks are usually studied in isolation. We have developed a new algorithm called master regulator inference analysis (MARINa) for discovering MRs of specific phenotypes and applied it to the HBCI to infer MRs of germinal center (GC) formation. GCs are structures where antigen‐stimulated B cells highly proliferate, undergo somatic hypermutation of immunoglobulin genes, and are selected based on the production of high‐affinity antibodies. GC B cells (centroblasts) derive from naive B cells, from which they differ for the activation of genetic programs controlling cell proliferation, DNA metabolism, and pro‐apoptotic programs and for the repression of anti‐apoptotic, cell‐cycle arrest, DNA repair, and signal transduction programs from cytokines and chemokines. MARINa recovered known MRs of GC B cells and also revealed a new transcription factor module controlling their proliferation. In particular, we identified MYB and FOXM1 as being key MRs of GC B cells. Indeed, 80\% of the genes jointly regulated by these transcription factors are activated in the GC, including those encoding proteins in a predicted complex regulating DNA pre‐replication, replication, and mitosis. We first tested whether MYB and FOXM1 may regulate each other as predicted in the HBCI, and show that MYB is a transcriptional activator of FOXM1, suggesting that they form a feed‐forward loop, involved in the synergistic activation of a large subset of GC‐specific genes. We then validated that common MYB/FOXM1 targets and other predicted MRs were affected by the silencing of either TF, using gene expression profiling. Furthermore, we showed that downregulated targets (AURKA, BUBR1, CCNB2, FANCI, MCM3, and PTTG1) and MRs (NFYB, E2F1, and E2F5) after MYB or FOXM1 silencing are indeed directly bound by them in their promoter region. Silencing of FOXM1 and MYB showed a decrease in proliferating cells and an increase in apoptotic cells, indicating that MYB and FOXM1 are necessary for viability and rapid proliferation of GC B cells. To gain more insight into the control of GC‐proliferation phenotype by MYB and FOXM1, we further examined specific targets involved in the formation of a predicted protein complex. Approximately half of MYB/FOXM1 targets cluster within a complex, including new interactions between pre‐replication and mitotic proteins. We experimentally validate that two mitotic kinases in the inferred complex, BUBR1 and AURKA, physically interact with MCM3, all of them being confirmed to be direct targets of FOXM1 and MYB. In summary, these results document that coordinated analysis of both transcriptional and post‐translational interactions in the HBCI can identify synergistic MRs of human phenotypes, as well as provide insight on the functional regulatory role of these proteins. These results indicate that the HBCI analysis can be used for the identification of determinants of major human cell phenotypes and provides a paradigm of general applicability to normal and pathologic tissues.

To investigate whether these DLBCL subtypes arise by distinct pathogenetic mechanisms, we analyzed 203 DLBCL biopsy samples by high-resolution, genome-wide copy number analysis coupled with gene-expression profiling. Of 272 recurrent chromosomal aberrations that were associated with gene-expression alterations, 30 were used differentially by the DLBCL subtypes (P {$<$} 0.006). An amplicon on chromosome 19 was detected in 26\% of ABC DLBCLs but in only 3\% of GCB DLBCLs and PMBLs. A highly up-regulated gene in this amplicon was SPIB, which encodes an ETS family transcription factor. Knockdown of SPIB by RNA interference was toxic to ABC DLBCL cell lines but not to GCB DLBCL, PMBL, or myeloma cell lines, strongly implicating SPIB as an oncogene involved in the pathogenesis of ABC DLBCL. Deletion of the INK4a/ARF tumor suppressor locus and trisomy 3 also occurred almost exclusively in ABC DLBCLs and was associated with inferior outcome within this subtype. FOXP1 emerged as a potential oncogene in ABC DLBCL that was up-regulated by trisomy 3 and by more focal high-level amplifications. In GCB DLBCL, amplification of the oncogenic mir-17–92 microRNA cluster and deletion of the tumor suppressor PTEN were recurrent, but these events did not occur in ABC DLBCL. Together, these data provide genetic evidence that the DLBCL subtypes are distinct diseases that use different oncogenic pathways.},

RESULTS: Despite similar expression of IL-15 mRNA, we found differences in IL-15 protein expression between normal human skin, atopic dermatitis and psoriasis on the one hand, and parapsoriasis and CTCL on the other. IL-15 protein expression was not detected in normal human skin, atopic dermatitis or psoriasis, but was detected, mainly at low levels but in a few patients at higher levels, in epidermal keratinocytes in parapsoriasis, mycosis fungoides and Sézary syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: Induction of keratinocyte IL-15 expression appears to be a feature of CTCL. The factors stimulating such an expression remain unknown.},

  abstract = {Focal amplifications of chromosome 3p13-3p14 occur in about 10\% of melanomas and are associated with a poor prognosis. The melanoma-specific oncogene MITF resides at the epicentre of this amplicon. However, whether other loci present in this amplicon also contribute to melanomagenesis is unknown. Here we show that the recently annotated long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) gene SAMMSON is consistently co-gained with MITF. In addition, SAMMSON is a target of the lineage-specific transcription factor SOX10 and its expression is detectable in more than 90\% of human melanomas. Whereas exogenous SAMMSON increases the clonogenic potential in trans, SAMMSON knockdown drastically decreases the viability of melanoma cells irrespective of their transcriptional cell state and BRAF, NRAS or TP53 mutational status. Moreover, SAMMSON targeting sensitizes melanoma to MAPK-targeting therapeutics both in vitro and in patient-derived xenograft models. Mechanistically, SAMMSON interacts with p32, a master regulator of mitochondrial homeostasis and metabolism, to increase its mitochondrial targeting and pro-oncogenic function. Our results indicate that silencing of the lineage addiction oncogene SAMMSON disrupts vital mitochondrial functions in a cancer-cell-specific manner; this silencing is therefore expected to deliver highly effective and tissue-restricted anti-melanoma therapeutic responses.},

Here we delineate allelic chromatin modifications and transcriptomes among a broad set of human tissues, enabled by a chromosome-spanning haplotype reconstruction strategy. The resulting large collection of haplotype-resolved epigenomic maps reveals extensive allelic biases in both chromatin state and transcription, which show considerable variation across tissues and between individuals, and allow us to investigate cis-regulatory relationships between genes and their control sequences. Analyses of histone modification maps also uncover intriguing characteristics of cis-regulatory elements and tissue-restricted activities of repetitive elements. The rich data sets described here will enhance our understanding of the mechanisms by which cis-regulatory elements control gene expression programs.},

The clinical and pathological features of acute lung injury (ALI) from SARS appear indistinguishable from ALI from other causes. The mainstay of treatments for ALI remains supportive. Patients with ALI from SARS who require mechanical ventilation should receive a lung protective, low tidal volume strategy. Adjuvant treatments recommended include prevention of venous thromboembolism, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and semirecumbent positioning during ventilation. Based on previous experience in Canada, infection control resources and protocols were recommended. Leadership structure, communication, training, and morale are an essential aspect of SARS management. A multicenter, placebo-controlled trial of corticosteroids for late SARS is justified because of widespread clinical use and uncertainties about relative risks and benefits. Studies of combined pathophysiologic endpoints were recommended, with mortality as a secondary endpoint. The group recommended preparation for studies, including protocols, ethical considerations, Web-based registries, and data entry systems.},

The treatment of this disease has changed little in the past two decades, because most of the genetic events that initiate the disease remain undiscovered. Whole-genome sequencing is now possible at a reasonable cost and timeframe to use this approach for the unbiased discovery of tumour-specific somatic mutations that alter the protein-coding genes. Here we present the results obtained from sequencing a typical acute myeloid leukaemia genome, and its matched normal counterpart obtained from the same patient's skin. We discovered ten genes with acquired mutations; two were previously described mutations that are thought to contribute to tumour progression, and eight were new mutations present in virtually all tumour cells at presentation and relapse, the function of which is not yet known. Our study establishes whole-genome sequencing as an unbiased method for discovering cancer-initiating mutations in previously unidentified genes that may respond to targeted therapies.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The genetic alterations responsible for an adverse outcome in most patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are unknown. METHODS: Using massively parallel DNA sequencing, we identified a somatic mutation in DNMT3A, encoding a DNA methyltransferase, in the genome of cells from a patient with AML with a normal karyotype. We sequenced the exons of DNMT3A in 280 additional patients with de novo AML to define recurring mutations. RESULTS: A total of 62 of 281 patients (22.1\%) had mutations in DNMT3A that were predicted to affect translation. We identified 18 different missense mutations, the most common of which was predicted to affect amino acid R882 (in 37 patients). We also identified six frameshift, six nonsense, and three splice-site mutations and a 1.5-Mbp deletion encompassing DNMT3A. These mutations were highly enriched in the group of patients with an intermediate-risk cytogenetic profile (56 of 166 patients, or 33.7\%) but were absent in all 79 patients with a favorable-risk cytogenetic profile (P{$<$}0.001 for both comparisons). The median overall survival among patients with DNMT3A mutations was significantly shorter than that among patients without such mutations (12.3 months vs. 41.1 months, P{$<$}0.001). DNMT3A mutations were associated with adverse outcomes among patients with an intermediate-risk cytogenetic profile or FLT3 mutations, regardless of age, and were independently associated with a poor outcome in Cox proportional-hazards analysis. CONCLUSIONS: DNMT3A mutations are highly recurrent in patients with de novo AML with an intermediate-risk cytogenetic profile and are independently associated with a poor outcome.

  abstract = {Recent advances in single-cell transcriptomics have illuminated the diverse neuronal and glial cell types within the human brain. However, the regulatory programs governing cell identity and function remain unclear. Using a single-nucleus assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (snATAC-seq), we explored open chromatin landscapes across 1.1 million cells in 42 brain regions from three adults. Integrating this data unveiled 107 distinct cell types and their specific utilization of 544,735 candidate cis-regulatory DNA elements (cCREs) in the human genome. Nearly a third of the cCREs demonstrated conservation and chromatin accessibility in the mouse brain cells. We reveal strong links between specific brain cell types and neuropsychiatric disorders including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and major depression, and have developed deep learning models to predict the regulatory roles of noncoding risk variants in these disorders.},

We identified an age-associated defect in T cell receptor (TCR)-induced extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation in naive CD4+ T cells, whereas other signals, such as ζ chain–associated protein kinase 70 (ZAP70) and phospholipase C-γ1 phosphorylation, were not impaired. The defective ERK signaling was caused by the dual specific phosphatase 6 (DUSP6), whose protein expression increased with age due to a decline in repression by miR-181a. Reconstitution of miR-181a lowered DUSP6 expression in naive CD4+ T cells in elderly individuals. DUSP6 repression using miR-181a or specific siRNA and DUSP6 inhibition by the allosteric inhibitor (E)-2-benzylidene-3-(cyclohexylamino)-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-one improved CD4+ T cell responses, as seen by increased expression of activation markers, improved proliferation and supported preferential T helper type 1 cell differentiation. DUSP6 is a potential intervention target for restoring T cell responses in the elderly, which may augment the effectiveness of vaccination.},

  abstract = {Genetic heterogeneity contributes to clinical outcome and progression of most tumors, but little is known about allelic diversity for epigenetic compartments, and almost no data exist for acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We examined epigenetic heterogeneity as assessed by cytosine methylation within defined genomic loci with four CpGs (epialleles), somatic mutations, and transcriptomes of AML patient samples at serial time points. We observed that epigenetic allele burden is linked to inferior outcome and varies considerably during disease progression. Epigenetic and genetic allelic burden and patterning followed different patterns and kinetics during disease progression. We observed a subset of AMLs with high epiallele and low somatic mutation burden at diagnosis, a subset with high somatic mutation and lower epiallele burdens at diagnosis, and a subset with a mixed profile, suggesting distinct modes of tumor heterogeneity. Genes linked to promoter-associated epiallele shifts during tumor progression showed increased single-cell transcriptional variance and differential expression, suggesting functional impact on gene regulation. Thus, genetic and epigenetic heterogeneity can occur with distinct kinetics likely to affect the biological and clinical features of tumors.},

We constructed spatial proximity maps of the human genome with Hi-C at a resolution of 1 megabase. These maps confirm the presence of chromosome territories and the spatial proximity of small, gene-rich chromosomes. We identified an additional level of genome organization that is characterized by the spatial segregation of open and closed chromatin to form two genome-wide compartments. At the megabase scale, the chromatin conformation is consistent with a fractal globule, a knot-free, polymer conformation that enables maximally dense packing while preserving the ability to easily fold and unfold any genomic locus. The fractal globule is distinct from the more commonly used globular equilibrium model. Our results demonstrate the power of Hi-C to map the dynamic conformations of whole genomes. Chromosomes are organized in a fractal knot-free conformation that is densely packed while easily folded and unfolded.

Biochemical analyses on the mechanisms of DNA breakage and rejoining permit formulation of detailed models of the human chromosomal translocation process in lymphoid neoplasms. Most human lymphomas are derived from B cells in which a DNA break at an oncogene is initiated by activation-induced deaminase (AID). The partner locus in many cases is located at one of the antigen receptor loci, and this break is generated by the recombination activating gene (RAG) complex or by AID. After breakage, the joining process typically occurs by non-homologous DNA end-joining (NHEJ). Some of the insights into this mechanism also apply to translocations that occur in non-lymphoid neoplasms.},

We found that miR-125b is expressed in bone marrow multipotent progenitors and myeloid cells but shut down in the B-cell lineage, and the gene encoding miR-125b lacked transcriptional activation markers in B cells. To understand the biological importance of the physiological silencing of miR-125b expression in B cells, we drove its expression in the B-cell lineage and found that dysregulated miR-125b expression impaired egress of immature B cells from the bone marrow to peripheral blood. Such impairment appeared to be mediated primarily by inhibited expression of the sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1PR1). Enforced expression of S1PR1 or clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/Cas9–mediated genome editing of the miR-125b targeting site in the S1PR1 3′ untranslated region rescued the miR-125b–mediated defect in B-cell egress. In addition to impaired B-cell egress, miR-125b dysregulation initially reduced pre–B-cell output but later induced pre–B-cell lymphoma/leukemia in mice. Genetic deletion of IRF4 was found in miR-125b–induced B-cell cancer, but its role in oncogenic miR-125b–induced B-cell transformation is still unknown. Here, we further demonstrated an interaction of the effects of miR-125b and IRF4 in cancer induction by showing that miR125b-induced B-cell leukemia was greatly accelerated in IRF4 homozygous mutant mice. Thus, we conclude that physiological silencing of miR-125b is required for normal B-cell development and also acts as a mechanism of cancer suppression.},

A vast number of circular RNAs (circRNAs) have been identified, and some have been shown to function as microRNA sponges in animal cells. Here, we report a class of circRNAs associated with RNA polymerase II in human cells. In these circRNAs, exons are circularized with introns 'retained' between exons; we term them exon-intron circRNAs or EIciRNAs. EIciRNAs predominantly localize in the nucleus, interact with U1 snRNP and promote transcription of their parental genes. Our findings reveal a new role for circRNAs in regulating gene expression in the nucleus, in which EIciRNAs enhance the expression of their parental genes in cis, and highlight a regulatory strategy for transcriptional control via specific RNA-RNA interaction between U1 snRNA and EIciRNAs.},

Cell viability and apoptosis were analyzed by CCK-8, BrdU assay, and flow cytometry. Results: We found that EYA4 was upregulated in glioma, and its expression was positively correlated with advanced tumor stage. Moreover, higher expression of EYA4 predicted a worse overall survival in patients with glioma. Forced overexpression of EYA4 enhanced glioma cell proliferation, and EYA4 suppressed the expression of p27Kip1 directly in these cells. Furthermore, Six1 was required for EYA4 to suppress the expression of p27Kip1 in glioma.

The discovery of the LCR in the β-globin locus and the characterization of LCRs in other loci reinforces the concept that developmental and cell lineage–specific regulation of gene expression relies not on gene-proximal elements such as promoters, enhancers, and silencers exclusively, but also on long-range interactions of variouscis regulatory elements and dynamic chromatin alterations.},

Here, we mapped the genome-wide loci bound by the RELA subunit of NF-κB in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated human monocytic cells, and together with global gene expression profiling, found an overrepresentation of the E2F1-binding motif among RELA-bound loci associated with NF-κB target genes. Knockdown of endogenous E2F1 impaired the LPS inducibility of the~proinflammatory cytokines CCL3(MIP-1α), IL23A(p19), TNF-α, and IL1-β. Upon LPS stimulation, E2F1 is rapidly recruited to the promoters of these genes along with p50/RELA heterodimer via a mechanism that is dependent on NF-κB activation. Together with the observation that E2F1 physically interacts with p50/RELA in LPS-stimulated cells, our findings suggest that NF-κB recruits E2F1 to fully activate the transcription of NF-κB target genes. Global gene expression profiling subsequently revealed a spectrum of NF-κB target genes that are positively regulated by E2F1, further demonstrating the critical role of E2F1 in the Toll-like receptor 4 pathway.},

  abstract = {Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) is a heterogeneous non-Hodgkin's lymphoma that may variably involve the skin, lymph nodes, and peripheral blood. Malignant burden ranges from cutaneous patches and plaques with little evidence of blood involvement to erythroderma often in association with frank leukemia, as in Sézary syndrome. Toward a better understanding of the pathogenesis of this CD4+ T-cell malignancy, we conducted a high-resolution genomic analysis combining DNA (23 samples) and mRNA (12 samples) data of peripheral blood isolates from CTCL patients across a spectrum of stages. Strikingly, even patients with limited involvement, e.g., normal CD4 counts, contained significant copy-number alterations. Defining genomic characteristics of CTCL blood involvement included gains on 8q and 17q, and deletions on 17p and chromosome 10. A consensus analysis of 108 leukemic CTCL samples demonstrated global similarities among patients with varied blood involvement, narrowing 38 of 62 loci. Toward an annotated framework for in vitro testing, we also characterized genomic alterations in five CTCL cell lines (HH, HUT78, PNO, SeAx, and Sez4), revealing intact core features of leukemic CTCL. Together, these studies produce the most comprehensive view of the leukemic CTCL genome to date, with implications for pathogenesis, molecular classification, and potential future therapeutic developments.},

  abstract = {Early B-cell factor (EBF) is a cell type-specific transcription factor that is expressed at all antigen-independent stages of B-lymphocyte differentiation and participates in the regulation of the mb-1 gene. Here we show, by targeted gene disruption in mice, that EBF is necessary for the generation of immunoglobulin-expressing B cells. EBF-deficient mice lack B cells that have rearranged their immunoglobulin D and JH gene segments, but contain B220+CD43+ progenitor cells that express germline mu and IL-7 receptor transcripts. Various non-lymphoid tissues that express EBF are apparently normal in homozygous mutant mice, including olfactory neurons in which EBF was identified as Olf-1 (refs 5, 6). Together, these data suggest that EBF plays a specific and important role in the transcriptional control of B-cell differentiation at a stage before Ig (immunoglobulin) gene rearrangement but after commitment of cells to the B-lymphoid lineage.},

  abstract = {CONTEXT: The identification of patients with inherited cancer susceptibility syndromes facilitates early diagnosis, prevention, and treatment. However, in many cases of suspected cancer susceptibility, the family history is unclear and genetic testing of common cancer susceptibility genes is unrevealing. OBJECTIVE: To apply whole-genome sequencing to a patient without any significant family history of cancer but with suspected increased cancer susceptibility because of multiple primary tumors to identify rare or novel germline variants in cancer susceptibility genes. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANT: Skin (normal) and bone marrow (leukemia) DNA were obtained from a patient with early-onset breast and ovarian cancer (negative for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations) and therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia (t-AML) and analyzed with the following: whole-genome sequencing using paired-end reads, single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping, RNA expression profiling, and spectral karyotyping. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Structural variants, copy number alterations, single-nucleotide variants, and small insertions and deletions (indels) were detected and validated using the described platforms. RESULTS; Whole-genome sequencing revealed a novel, heterozygous 3-kilobase deletion removing exons 7-9 of TP53 in the patient's normal skin DNA, which was homozygous in the leukemia DNA as a result of uniparental disomy. In addition, a total of 28 validated somatic single-nucleotide variations or indels in coding genes, 8 somatic structural variants, and 12 somatic copy number alterations were detected in the patient's leukemia genome. CONCLUSION: Whole-genome sequencing can identify novel, cryptic variants in cancer susceptibility genes in addition to providing unbiased information on the spectrum of mutations in a cancer genome.},

  abstract = {Although long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) predominately reside in the nucleus and exert their functions in many biological processes, their potential involvement in cytoplasmic signal transduction remains unexplored. Here, we identify a cytoplasmic lncRNA, LINK-A (long intergenic non-coding RNA for kinase activation), which mediates HB-EGF-triggered, EGFR:GPNMB heterodimer-dependent HIF1α phosphorylation at Tyr 565 and Ser 797 by BRK and LRRK2, respectively. These events cause HIF1α stabilization, HIF1α–p300 interaction, and activation of HIF1α transcriptional programs under normoxic conditions. Mechanistically, LINK-A facilitates the recruitment of BRK to the EGFR:GPNMB complex and BRK kinase activation. The BRK-dependent HIF1α Tyr 565 phosphorylation interferes with Pro 564 hydroxylation, leading to normoxic HIF1α stabilization. Both LINK-A expression and LINK-A-dependent signalling pathway activation correlate with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), promoting breast cancer glycolysis reprogramming and tumorigenesis. Our findings illustrate the magnitude and diversity of cytoplasmic lncRNAs in signal transduction and highlight the important roles of lncRNAs in cancer.},

  abstract = {CPEB is a sequence-specific RNA binding protein that promotes polyadenylation-induced translation in early development, during cell cycle progression and cellular senescence, and following neuronal synapse stimulation. It controls polyadenylation and translation through other interacting molecules, most notably the poly(A) polymerase Gld2, the deadenylating enzyme PARN, and the eIF4E-binding protein Maskin. Here, we report that CPEB shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm and that its export occurs via the CRM1-dependent pathway. In the nucleus of Xenopus oocytes, CPEB associates with lampbrush chromosomes and several proteins involved in nuclear RNA processing. CPEB also interacts with Maskin in the nucleus as well as with CPE-containing mRNAs. Although the CPE does not regulate mRNA export, it influences the degree to which mRNAs are translationally repressed in the cytoplasm. Moreover, CPEB directly or indirectly mediates the alternative splicing of at least one pre-mRNA in mouse embryo fibroblasts as well as certain mouse tissues. We propose that CPEB, together with Maskin, binds mRNA in the nucleus to ensure tight translational repression upon export to the cytoplasm. In addition, we propose that nuclear CPEB regulates specific pre-mRNA alternative splicing.},

We present PhyloCSF, a novel comparative genomics method that analyzes a multispecies nucleotide sequence alignment to determine whether it is likely to represent a conserved protein-coding region, based on a formal statistical comparison of phylogenetic codon models. Results: We show that PhyloCSF's classification performance in 12-species Drosophila genome alignments exceeds all other methods we compared in a previous study. We anticipate that this method will be widely applicable as the transcriptomes of many additional species, tissues and subcellular compartments are sequenced, particularly in the context of ENCODE and modENCODE, and as interest grows in long non-coding RNAs, often initially recognized by their lack of protein coding potential rather than conserved RNA secondary structures.

  abstract = {CRISPR–Cas9-based genetic screens have successfully identified cell type–dependent liabilities in cancer, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML), a devastating hematologic malignancy with poor overall survival. Because most of these screens have been performed in vitro using established cell lines, evaluating the physiologic relevance of these targets is critical. We have established a CRISPR screening approach using orthotopic xenograft models to validate and prioritize AML-enriched dependencies in vivo, including in CRISPR-competent AML patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models tractable for genome editing. Our integrated pipeline has revealed several targets with translational value, including SLC5A3 as a metabolic vulnerability for AML addicted to exogenous myo-inositol and MARCH5 as a critical guardian to prevent apoptosis in AML. MARCH5 repression enhanced the efficacy of BCL2 inhibitors such as venetoclax, further highlighting the clinical potential of targeting MARCH5 in AML. Our study provides a valuable strategy for discovery and prioritization of new candidate AML therapeutic targets.There is an unmet need to improve the clinical outcome of AML. We developed an integrated in vivo screening approach to prioritize and validate AML dependencies with high translational potential. We identified SLC5A3 as a metabolic vulnerability and MARCH5 as a critical apoptosis regulator in AML, both of which represent novel therapeutic opportunities.This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 275},

Here we show that concomitant loss of Tet2 and Tet3 in mice at early B cell stage blocked the pro- to pre-B cell transition in the bone marrow, decreased Irf4 expression and impaired the germline transcription and rearrangement of the Igκ locus. Tet2/3-deficient pro-B cells showed increased CpG methylation at the Igκ 3’ and distal enhancers that was mimicked by depletion of E2A or PU.1, as well as a global decrease in chromatin accessibility at enhancers. Importantly, re-expression of the Tet2 catalytic domain in Tet2/3-deficient B cells resulted in demethylation of the Igκ enhancers and restored their chromatin accessibility. Our data suggest that TET proteins and lineage-specific transcription factors cooperate to influence chromatin accessibility and Igκ enhancer function by modulating the modification status of DNA., DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.18290.001},

Here we show that concomitant loss of Tet2 and Tet3 in mice at early B cell stage blocked the pro- to pre-B cell transition in the bone marrow, decreased Irf4 expression and impaired the germline transcription and rearrangement of the Igκ locus. Tet2/3-deficient pro-B cells showed increased CpG methylation at the Igκ 3' and distal enhancers that was mimicked by depletion of E2A or PU.1, as well as a global decrease in chromatin accessibility at enhancers. Importantly, re-expression of the Tet2 catalytic domain in Tet2/3-deficient B cells resulted in demethylation of the Igκ enhancers and restored their chromatin accessibility. Our data suggest that TET proteins and lineage-specific transcription factors cooperate to influence chromatin accessibility and Igκ enhancer function by modulating the modification status of DNA.},

  abstract = {Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a highly invasive brain tumor with limited therapeutic means and poor prognosis. Recent studies indicate that glioma-initiating cells/glioma stem cells (GICs/GSCs) may be responsible for tumor initiation, infiltration, and recurrence. GICs could aberrantly employ molecular machinery balancing self-renewal and differentiation of embryonic neural precursors. Here, we find that paired related homeobox 1 (PRRX1), a homeodomain transcription factor that was previously reported to control skeletal development, is expressed in cortical neural progenitors and is required for their self-renewal and proper differentiation. Further, PRRX1 is overrepresented in glioma samples and labels GICs. Glioma cells and GICs depleted with PRRX1 could not propagate in vitro or form tumors in the xenograft mouse model. The GIC self-renewal function regulated by PRRX1 is mediated by dopamine D2 receptor (DRD2). PRRX1 directly binds to the DRD2 promoter and transactivates its expression in GICs. Blockage of the DRD2 signaling hampers GIC self-renewal, whereas its overexpression restores the propagating and tumorigenic potential of PRRX1-depleted GICs. Finally, PRRX1 potentiates GICs via DRD2-mediated extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) and AKT activation. Thus, our study suggests that therapeutic targeting the PRRX1−DRD2−ERK/AKT axis in GICs is a promising strategy for treating GBMs.},

  abstract = {Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) is a potentially devastating malignancy. The pathogenesis of this cancer remains poorly elucidated. Previous studies focused on analysis of expression and function of known oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. However, emerging reports highlight that it is also important to analyze the expression of genes that are ectopically expressed in CTCL (e.g., embryonic stem cell genes (ESC), cancer testis (CT) genes, etc.). Currently, it is not known whether ESC genes are expressed in CTCL. In the current work, we analyze by RT-PCR the expression of 26 ESC genes, many of which are known to regulate pluripotency and promote cancer stem cell-like phenotype, in a historic cohort of 60 patients from Boston and in a panel of 11 patient-derived CTCL cell lines and compare such expression to benign inflammatory dermatoses that often clinically mimic CTCL. Our findings document that many critical ESC genes including NANOG, SOX2, OCT4 (POU5F1) and their upstream and downstream signaling members are expressed in CTCL. Similarly, polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) genes (i.e., EZH2, EED, and SUZ12) are also expressed in CTCL lesional skin. Furthermore, select ESC genes (OCT4, EED, TCF3, THAP11, CHD7, TIP60, TRIM28) are preferentially expressed in CTCL samples when compared to benign skin biopsies. Our work suggests that ESC genes are ectopically expressed together with CT genes, thymocyte development genes and B cell-specific genes and may be working in concert to promote tumorigenesis. Specifically, while ESC genes may be promoting cancer stem cell-like phenotype, CT genes may be contributing to aneuploidy and genomic instability by producing aberrant chromosomal translocations. Further analysis of ESC expression and function in this cancer will greatly enhance our fundamental understanding of CTCL and will help us identify novel therapeutic targets.},

To date, the epigenetic and transcriptional characteristics of quiescent stem cells and how they change with age remain largely unknown. In this study, we explore the chromatin features of adult skeletal muscle stem cells, or satellite cells (SCs), which reside predominantly in a quiescent state in fully developed limb muscles of both young and aged mice. Using a ChIP-seq approach to obtain global epigenetic profiles of quiescent SCs (QSCs), we show that QSCs possess a permissive chromatin state in which few genes are epigenetically repressed by Polycomb group (PcG)-mediated histone 3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3), and a large number of~genes encoding regulators that specify nonmyogenic lineages are demarcated by bivalent domains at their transcription start sites (TSSs). By comparing epigenetic profiles of QSCs from young and old mice,~we also provide direct evidence that, with age, epigenetic changes accumulate and may lead to a functional decline in quiescent stem cells. These findings highlight the importance of chromatin mapping in understanding unique features of stem cell identity and stem cell aging.},

  abstract = {A very focused function for lncRNAs The human genome generates many thousands of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). A very small number of lncRNAs have been shown to be functional. Liu et al. carried out a large-scale CRISPR-based screen to assess the function of ∼17,000 lncRNAs in seven different human cell lines. A considerable number (∼500) of the tested lncRNAs influenced cell growth, suggesting biological function. In almost all cases, though, the function was highly cell type—specific, often limited to just one cell type. Science, this issue p. 10.1126/science.aah7111 Structured Abstract INTRODUCTIONThe human genome contains tens of thousands of loci that produce long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), transcripts that have no apparent protein-coding potential. A subset of lncRNAs have been found to play critical roles in cellular processes, organismal development, and disease. Although these examples are suggestive of the importance and diversity of lncRNAs, the vast majority of lncRNA genes have not been functionally tested. RATIONALEBecause it is currently not possible to predict which lncRNA loci are functional or what function they perform, there is a need for large-scale, systematic approaches to interrogating the functional contribution of lncRNA loci. We therefore developed a genome-scale screening platform based on CRISPR-mediated interference (CRISPRi), which uses a catalytically inactive CRISPR effector protein, (d)Cas9, fused to a repressive KRAB domain and targeted by a single guide RNA (sgRNA), to inhibit gene expression. By catalyzing repressive chromatin modifications around the transcription start site (TSS) and serving as a transcriptional roadblock, CRISPRi tests a broad range of lncRNA gene functions, including the production of cis- and trans-acting RNA transcripts, cis-mediated regulation related to lncRNA transcription itself, and enhancer-like function of some lncRNA loci. RESULTSWe designed a CRISPRi Non-Coding Library (CRiNCL), which targets 16,401 lncRNA genes each with 10 sgRNAs per TSS, and applied this pooled screening approach to identify lncRNA genes that modify robust cell growth. We screened seven human cell lines, including six transformed cell lines and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), and identified 499 lncRNA loci that modified cell growth upon CRISPRi targeting; 372 and 299 of these loci were distal from any protein coding gene or mapped enhancer, respectively. Extensive validation confirmed the screen results and demonstrated the robust and specific performance of CRISPRi for repressing lncRNA transcription. Remarkably, 89\% of the lncRNA gene hits modified growth in just one of the cell lines tested, and no hits were common to all seven cell lines. Although nearly all of the hit genes were expressed in the cell line in which they exhibited a growth phenotype, expression alone was insufficient to explain the cell type specificity of their function. Transcriptional profiling revealed extensive gene expression changes upon CRISPRi targeting of lncRNA loci in the cells in which they modified growth, whereas targeting the same lncRNA locus in other cell lines resulted in minimal changes to the transcriptome beyond depletion of the targeted lncRNA transcript itself. CONCLUSIONOur study considerably increases the number of known functional lncRNA loci. More broadly, our CRISPRi approach enables mechanistic studies of specific lncRNA functions and, when applied systematically, supports the global exploration of the complex biology contained in the lncRNA-expressing genome. Finally, in contrast to recent studies that found that essential protein-coding genes typically are required across a broad range of cell types, we show that lncRNA function is highly cell type–specific, a finding that has important implications for their involvement in both normal biology and disease. {$<$}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="https://d2ufo47lrtsv5s.cloudfront.net/content/sci/355/6320/eaah7111/F1.medium.gif"/{$>$} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint CRISPRi screening of lncRNAs in human cells.CRISPRi can precisely repress transcription of lncRNAs. The CRISPRi Non-Coding Library (CRiNCL) was generated to interrogate the function of thousands of long noncoding RNAs in seven different cell lines. Validation studies confirmed the exquisite cell type–specific function of lncRNAs. The human genome produces thousands of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs)—transcripts {$>$}200 nucleotides long that do not encode proteins. Although critical roles in normal biology and disease have been revealed for a subset of lncRNAs, the function of the vast majority remains untested. We developed a CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) platform targeting 16,401 lncRNA loci in seven diverse cell lines, including six transformed cell lines and human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Large-scale screening identified 499 lncRNA loci required for robust cellular growth, of which 89\% showed growth-modifying function exclusively in one cell type. We further found that lncRNA knockdown can perturb complex transcriptional networks in a cell type–specific manner. These data underscore the functional importance and cell type specificity of many lncRNAs. A considerable fraction of long noncoding RNAs have highly cell type–specific biological functions.

In this study, we found that both marginal zone precursor (MZP) and MZB were decreased in FcμR−/− mice. The reduction of MZP and MZB was not due to impaired proliferation of these cells but rather due to their increased death. Further analysis revealed that FcμR−/− MZB had reduced tonic BCR signal, as evidenced by their decreased levels of phosphorylated SYK and AKT relative to WT MZB. MZB in FcμR−/− mice responded poorly to LPS in vivo when compared with MZB in WT mice. Consistent with the reduced proportion of MZB and their impaired response to LPS, antibody production against the type 1 T-independent Ag, NP-LPS, was significantly reduced in FcμR−/− mice. Moreover, FcμR−/− mice were highly susceptible to Citrobacter rodentium-induced sepsis. These results reveal a critical role for FcμR in the survival and activation of MZB and in protection against acute bacterial infection.},

  abstract = {Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerged as critical regulators in various cellular processes. However, the potential involvement of lncRNAs in kinase signalling remains largely unknown. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) acts as a critical sensor of cellular energy status. Here we show that the lncRNA NBR2 (neighbour of BRCA1 gene 2) is induced by the LKB1–AMPK pathway under energy stress. On energy stress, NBR2 in turn interacts with AMPK and promotes AMPK kinase activity, thus forming a feed-forward loop to potentiate AMPK activation during energy stress. Depletion of NBR2 attenuates energy-stress-induced AMPK activation, resulting in unchecked cell cycling, altered apoptosis/autophagy response, and increased tumour development in vivo. NBR2 is downregulated and its low expression correlates with poor clinical outcomes in some human cancers. Together, the results of our study uncover a mechanism coupling lncRNAs with metabolic stress response, and provides a broad framework to understand further the regulation of kinase signalling by lncRNAs.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To report the laboratory investigation of a case of severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) with maternal T-cell engraftment, focusing on the interference of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing by blood chimerism. METHODS: HLA typing was performed with three different methods, including sequence-specific primer (SSP), sequence-specific oligonucleotide, and Sanger sequencing on peripheral blood leukocytes and buccal cells, from a 3-month-old boy and peripheral blood leukocytes from his parents. Short tandem repeat (STR) testing was performed in parallel. RESULTS: HLA typing of the patient's peripheral blood leukocytes using the SSP method demonstrated three different alleles for each of the HLA-B and HLA-C loci, with both maternal alleles present at each locus. Typing results from the patient's buccal cells showed a normal pattern of inheritance for paternal and maternal haplotypes. STR enrichment testing of the patient's CD3+ T lymphocytes and CD15+ myeloid cells confirmed maternal T-cell engraftment, while the myeloid cell profile matched the patient's buccal cells. CONCLUSIONS: Maternal T-cell engraftment may interfere with HLA typing in patients with SCID. Selection of the appropriate typing methods and specimens is critical for accurate HLA typing and immunologic assessment before allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.},

Functional study of these cell types has been hampered by a lack of precise purification methods. We describe a method for prospectively isolating ten distinct NSPC types from the developing human brain using cell-surface markers. CD24−THY1−/lo cells were enriched for radial glia, which robustly engrafted and differentiated into all three neural lineages in the mouse brain. THY1hi cells marked unipotent oligodendrocyte precursors committed to an oligodendroglial fate, and CD24+THY1−/lo cells marked committed excitatory and inhibitory neuronal lineages. Notably, we identify and functionally characterize a transcriptomically distinct THY1hiEGFRhiPDGFRA− bipotent glial progenitor cell (GPC), which is lineage-restricted to astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, but not to neurons. Our study provides a framework for the functional study of distinct cell types in human neurodevelopment.},

In this report the protein binding to one specific region within a hypersensitive site approximately 200 base pairs upstream of the start of transcription has been analysed in detail. Using a combination of a modified agarose gel retardation assay with O-phenanthroline-copper footprinting in situ, missing contact point and methylation interference techniques, two proteins were found to bind to overlapping sequences within 180-230 bp upstream of the start of transcription. One protein resembles the transcription factor Sp1, the other is a protein which binds to three regularly spaced repeats of the core sequence CCCTC. This CCCTC-binding factor was termed CTCF. It requires additional sequences outside the three recognition motifs for tight binding. CTCF was purified to near homogeneity by sequence-specific DNA chromatography. The approximate molecular weight of the CTCF was estimated to be 130,000. Removal of 110 bp sequence binding both CTCF and Sp1-like proteins leads to a 4 to 8-fold increase in transcription of stably transfected c-myc fusion constructs in chicken embryonic fibroblasts, suggesting that the CTCF is likely to be one of multiple nuclear factors involved in the transcriptional regulation of the chicken c-myc gene.},

IL-15Rα−/− mice are markedly lymphopenic despite grossly normal T and B lymphocyte development.

These mice are also deficient in natural killer cells, natural killer T cells, CD8+ T lymphocytes, and TCRγδ intraepithelial lymphocytes. In addition, memory phenotype CD8+ T cells are selectively reduced in number.

In order to investigate the clonal evolution of this lymphoma, we studied paired primary and relapse tumor samples from 33 patients with recurrent non-transformed t(14;18)-positive FL. We reconstructed phylogenetic trees of the evolution by taking advantage of the activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID)-mediated somatic hypermutation (SHM) active in the germinal center reaction using sequences of the clonal VHDHJH rearrangements of the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGH) locus. Mutational analysis of the IGH locus showed evidence for ongoing somatic mutation and for counter-selection of mutations affecting the BCR conformation during tumor evolution. We further followed evolutionary divergence by targeted sequencing of gene loci affected by aberrant SHM as well as of known driver genes of lymphomagenesis, and by array-based genome-wide chromosomal imbalance and DNA methylation analysis. We observed a wide spectrum of evolutionary patterns ranging from almost no evolution to divergent evolution within recurrent non-transformed t(14;18) FL. Remarkably, we observed a correlation of the magnitude of evolutionary divergence across all genetic and epigenetic levels suggesting co-evolution. The distribution of coding mutations in driver genes and the correlation with SHM suggest CREBBP and AID to be potential modifiers of genetic and epigenetic co-evolution in FL.},

  abstract = {To gain insight into the genomic basis of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), we performed massively parallel whole-exome sequencing of 55 primary tumor samples from patients with DLBCL and matched normal tissue. We identified recurrent mutations in genes that are well known to be functionally relevant in DLBCL, including MYD88, CARD11, EZH2, and CREBBP. We also identified somatic mutations in genes for which a functional role in DLBCL has not been previously suspected. These genes include MEF2B, MLL2, BTG1, GNA13, ACTB, P2RY8, PCLO, and TNFRSF14. Further, we show that BCL2 mutations commonly occur in patients with BCL2/IgH rearrangements as a result of somatic hypermutation normally occurring at the IgH locus. The BCL2 point mutations are primarily synonymous, and likely caused by activation-induced cytidine deaminase–mediated somatic hypermutation, as shown by comprehensive analysis of enrichment of mutations in WRCY target motifs. Those nonsynonymous mutations that are observed tend to be found outside of the functionally important BH domains of the protein, suggesting that strong negative selection against BCL2 loss-of-function mutations is at play. Last, by using an algorithm designed to identify likely functionally relevant but infrequent mutations, we identify KRAS, BRAF, and NOTCH1 as likely drivers of DLBCL pathogenesis in some patients. Our data provide an unbiased view of the landscape of mutations in DLBCL, and this in turn may point toward new therapeutic strategies for the disease.},

  abstract = {Sustained engagement of the B-cell receptor (BCR) increases apoptosis resistance in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) B cells, whereas transient stimulation usually has an opposite effect. The antiapoptotic BCR signal has been associated with prolonged activation of the PI3K/Akt and MEK/ERK pathways, which are key regulators of survival and proliferation in various cell types. To further define the relative contribution of the Akt and ERK kinases in regulating CLL B-cell survival, we introduced constitutively active mutants of Akt and MEK in primary CLL B cells and evaluated changes in the expression of relevant pro- and antiapoptotic proteins. Sustained activation of Akt resulted in increased leukemic cell viability and increased expression of the antiapoptotic proteins Mcl-1, Bcl-xL, and X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP), thus largely recapitulating the effects of sustained BCR stimulation. Constitutively active MEK2 also up-regulated XIAP, but did not show a significant impact on leukemic cell survival. Down-regulation of Mcl-1 by siRNA treatment induced rapid and potent apoptosis in CLL B cells and blocked the antiapoptotic effect of sustained BCR stimulation, whereas down-regulation of Bcl-xL and XIAP did not affect leukemic cell viability. These data demonstrate that Akt and Mcl-1 are major components of a survival pathway that can be activated in CLL B cells by antigen stimulation.},

  abstract = {A greater understanding of the function of the human immune system at the single-cell level in healthy individuals is critical for discerning aberrant cellular behavior that occurs in settings such as autoimmunity, immunosenescence, and cancer. To achieve this goal, a systems-level approach capable of capturing the response of the interdependent immune cell types to external stimuli is required. In this study, an extensive characterization of signaling responses in multiple immune cell subpopulations within PBMCs from a cohort of 60 healthy donors was performed using single-cell network profiling (SCNP). SCNP is a multiparametric flow cytometry-based approach that enables the simultaneous measurement of basal and evoked signaling in multiple cell subsets within heterogeneous populations. In addition to establishing the interindividual degree of variation within a broad panel of immune signaling responses, the possible association of any observed variation with demographic variables including age and race was investigated. Using half of the donors as a training set, multiple age- and race-associated variations in signaling responses in discrete cell subsets were identified, and several were subsequently confirmed in the remaining samples (test set). Such associations may provide insight into age-related immune alterations associated with high infection rates and diminished protection following vaccination and into the basis for ethnic differences in autoimmune disease incidence and treatment response. SCNP allowed for the generation of a functional map of healthy immune cell signaling responses that can provide clinically relevant information regarding both the mechanisms underlying immune pathological conditions and the selection and effect of therapeutics.},

In NF1 patients, neurological issues may result from damaged myelin, and mice with a neurofibromin gene (Nf1) mutation show white matter (WM) defects including myelin decompaction. Using mouse genetics, we find that altered Nf1 gene-dose in mature oligodendrocytes results in progressive myelin defects and behavioral abnormalities mediated by aberrant Notch activation. Blocking Notch, upstream mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), or nitric oxide signaling rescues myelin defects in hemizygous Nf1 mutants, and pharmacological gamma secretase inhibition rescues aberrant behavior with no effects in wild-type (WT) mice. Concomitant pathway inhibition rescues myelin abnormalities in homozygous mutants. Notch activation is also observed in Nf1+/− mouse brains, and cells containing active Notch are increased in NF1 patient WM. We thus identify Notch as an Nf1 effector regulating myelin structure and behavior in a RASopathy and suggest that inhibition of Notch signaling may be a therapeutic strategy for NF1.},

At the same time, it remains wedded to other established approaches to tumor diagnosis such as histology and immunohistochemistry. In doing so, the fifth edition establishes some different approaches to both CNS tumor nomenclature and grading and it emphasizes the importance of integrated diagnoses and layered reports. New tumor types and subtypes are introduced, some based on novel diagnostic technologies such as DNA methylome profiling. The present review summarizes the major general changes in the 2021 fifth edition classification and the specific changes in each taxonomic category.

Despite the well-established understanding of the molecular mechanisms occurring during miR-15a/16-1 dysregulation, the oncogenic role of other miR-15/16 family members, such as the miR-15b/16-2 cluster (3q25), is still far from being elucidated. Whereas miR-15a is highly similar to miR-15b, miR-16-1 is identical to miR-16-2; thus, it could be speculated that both clusters control a similar set of target genes and may have overlapping functions. However, the biological role of miR-15b/16-2 is still controversial. We generated miR-15b/16-2 knockout mice to better understand the cluster’s role in vivo. These mice developed B-cell malignancy by age 15–18 mo with a penetrance of 60\%. At this stage, mice showed significantly enlarged spleens with abnormal B cell-derived white pulp enlargement. Flow cytometric analysis demonstrated an expanded CD19+ CD5+ population in the spleen of 40\% knockout mice, a characteristic of the chronic lymphocytic leukemia-associated phenotype found in humans. Of note, miR-15b/16-2 modulates the CCND2 (Cyclin D2), CCND1 (Cyclin D1), and IGF1R (insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor) genes involved in proliferation and antiapoptotic pathways in mouse B cells. These results are the first, to our knowledge, to suggest an important role of miR-15b/16-2 loss in the pathogenesis of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia.},

The global effects of GlcNAcylation on transcription can be addressed directly in C. elegans because knockouts of the O-GlcNAc cycling enzymes are viable and fertile. Using anti-O-GlcNAc ChIP-on-chip whole-genome tiling arrays on wild-type and mutant strains, we detected over 800 promoters where O-GlcNAc cycling occurs, including microRNA loci and multigene operons. Intriguingly, O-GlcNAc-marked promoters are biased toward genes associated with PIP3 signaling, hexosamine biosynthesis, and lipid/carbohydrate metabolism. These marked genes are linked to insulin-like signaling, metabolism, aging, stress, and pathogen-response pathways in C. elegans. Whole-genome transcriptional profiling of the O-GlcNAc cycling mutants confirmed dramatic deregulation of genes in these key pathways. As predicted, the O-GlcNAc cycling mutants show altered lifespan and UV stress susceptibility phenotypes. We propose that O-GlcNAc cycling at promoters participates in a molecular program impacting nutrient-responsive pathways in C. elegans, including stress, pathogen response, and adult lifespan. The observed impact of O-GlcNAc cycling on both signaling and transcription in C. elegans has important implications for human diseases of aging, including diabetes and neurodegeneration.},

Paediatric cancers exhibit few mutations genome-wide but frequently harbour sentinel mutations that affect TFs, which provides a context to precisely study the transcriptional circuits that support mutant TF-driven oncogenesis. A broadly relevant mechanism that has garnered intense focus involves the ability of mutant TFs to hijack wild-type lineage-specific TFs in self-reinforcing transcriptional circuits. However, it is not known whether this specific type of circuitry is equally crucial in all mutant TF-driven cancers. Here we describe an alternative yet central transcriptional mechanism that promotes Ewing sarcoma, wherein constraint, rather than reinforcement, of the activity of the fusion TF EWS–FLI supports cancer growth. We discover that ETV6 is a crucial TF dependency that is specific to this disease because it, counter-intuitively, represses the transcriptional output of EWS–FLI. This work discovers a previously undescribed transcriptional mechanism that promotes cancer.},

  abstract = {Recurrent mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) and IDH2 have been identified in gliomas, acute myeloid leukaemias (AML) and chondrosarcomas, and share a novel enzymatic property of producing 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG) from α-ketoglutarate. Here we report that 2HG-producing IDH mutants can prevent the histone demethylation that is required for lineage-specific progenitor cells to differentiate into terminally differentiated cells. In tumour samples from glioma patients, IDH mutations were associated with a distinct gene expression profile enriched for genes expressed in neural progenitor cells, and this was associated with increased histone methylation. To test whether the ability of IDH mutants to promote histone methylation contributes to a block in cell differentiation in non-transformed cells, we tested the effect of neomorphic IDH mutants on adipocyte differentiation in vitro. Introduction of either mutant IDH or cell-permeable 2HG was associated with repression of the inducible expression of lineage-specific differentiation genes and a block to differentiation. This correlated with a significant increase in repressive histone methylation marks without observable changes in promoter DNA methylation. Gliomas were found to have elevated levels of similar histone repressive marks. Stable transfection of a 2HG-producing mutant IDH into immortalized astrocytes resulted in progressive accumulation of histone methylation. Of the marks examined, increased H3K9 methylation reproducibly preceded a rise in DNA methylation as cells were passaged in culture. Furthermore, we found that the 2HG-inhibitable H3K9 demethylase KDM4C was induced during adipocyte differentiation, and that RNA-interference suppression of KDM4C was sufficient to block differentiation. Together these data demonstrate that 2HG can inhibit histone demethylation and that inhibition of histone demethylation can be sufficient to block the differentiation of non-transformed cells.},

How then is the selective pressure for a single miRNA/target interaction maintained across long evolutionary distances? We addressed this problem by disrupting in vivo the interaction between miR-155 and PU.1 in mice. Remarkably, this interaction proved to be key to promoting optimal T cell–dependent B cell responses, a previously unrecognized role for PU.1. Mechanistically, miR-155 inhibits PU.1 expression, leading to Pax5 down-regulation and the initiation of the plasma cell differentiation pathway. Additional PU.1 targets include a network of genes whose products are involved in adhesion, with direct links to B–T cell interactions. We conclude that the evolutionary adaptive selection of the miR-155–PU.1 interaction is exercised through the effectiveness of terminal B cell differentiation.},

CD26 (also known as dipeptidyl peptidase 4, DPP4) was recently identified as the cellular receptor for MERS-CoV. The engagement of the MERS-CoV spike protein with CD26 mediates viral attachment to host cells and virus–cell fusion, thereby initiating infection. Here we delineate the molecular basis of this specific interaction by presenting the first crystal structures of both the free receptor binding domain (RBD) of the MERS-CoV spike protein and its complex with CD26. Furthermore, binding between the RBD and CD26 is measured using real-time surface plasmon resonance with a dissociation constant of 16.7 nM. The viral RBD is composed of a core subdomain homologous to that of the SARS-CoV spike protein, and a unique strand-dominated external receptor binding motif that recognizes blades IV and V of the CD26 β-propeller. The atomic details at the interface between the two binding entities reveal a surprising protein–protein contact mediated mainly by hydrophilic residues. Sequence alignment indicates, among betacoronaviruses, a possible structural conservation for the region homologous to the MERS-CoV RBD core, but a high variation in the external receptor binding motif region for virus-specific pathogenesis such as receptor recognition.},

These include activating and inactivating mutations of genes that perform post-translational modification of histones and organize chromatin structure. Here, we discuss the function of histone acetyltransferases (CREBBP, EP300), histone methyltransferases (KDM2C/D, EZH2) and regulators of higher order chromatin structure (HIST1H1C/D/E, ARID1A and SMARCA4) that have been reported to be mutated in 5\% of DLBCL, FL or BL.

These lncRNA genes share epigenetic features with protein-coding genes, including regulated expression via DNA methylation, and knocking down two LncHSCs revealed distinct effects on HSC~self-renewal and lineage commitment.

  abstract = {Alterations to the epigenetic landscape of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) play a fundamental role in deregulating genes involved in normal lymphocyte differentiation. To determine whether targeted epigenetic therapy could reverse these pathogenic chromatin changes and suppress the expression of a lymphoma oncogene, we focused on BCL6, a transcriptional repressor whose aberrant expression is tightly linked to DLBCL proliferation and survival. We fused zinc-finger (ZF) domains specific for regulatory regions in the BCL6 locus to a repressive epigenetic modifier, the Kruppel-associated box (KRAB) repressor domain. Distinct ZF–KRAB fusions repressed the local chromatin landscape, suppressed BCL6 expression, significantly impaired DLBCL growth, and caused widespread cell death in a BCL6-dependent manner. Importantly, expression of ectopic BCL6 protein rescued ZF–KRAB-induced cell death, demonstrating the modifiers’ specificity. We show that sequence-specific epigenetic modifiers can alter oncogene expression and induce apoptosis in cancer cells, underscoring their potential for future development as targeted epigenetic protein therapies.},

  abstract = {Zinc finger proteins containing the Kruppel associated box (KRAB-ZFPs) constitute the largest individual family of transcriptional repressors encoded by the genomes of higher organisms. KRAB domain, positioned at the NH2 terminus of the KRAB-ZFPs, interacts with a scaffold protein, KAP-1, which is able to recruit various transcriptional factors causing repression of genes to which KRAB ZFPs bind. The relevance of such repression is reflected in the large number of the KRAB zinc finger protein genes in the human genome. However, in spite of their numerical abundance little is currently known about the gene targets and the physiological functions of KRAB- ZFPs. However, emerging evidence links the transcriptional repression mediated by the KRAB-ZFPs to cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis and cancer. Moreover, the fact that KRAB containing proteins are vertebrate-specific suggests that they have evolved recently, and that their key roles lie in some aspects of vertebrate development. In this review, we will briefly discuss some regulatory functions of the KRAB-ZFPs in different physiological and pathological states, thus contributing to better understand their biological roles.},

  abstract = {Transcytosis of the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR) is stimulated by binding of its ligand, dimeric IgA (dIgA). During this process, dIgA binding at the basolateral surface of the epithelial cell transmits a signal to the apical region of the cell, which in turn stimulates the transport of dIgA–pIgR complex from a postmicrotubule compartment to the apical surface. We have previously reported that the signal of stimulation was controlled by a protein-tyrosine kinase (PTK) activated upon dIgA binding. We now show that this signal of stimulation moves across the cell independently of pIgR movement or microtubules and acts through the tyrosine kinase activity by releasing Ca++ from inositol trisphosphate–sensitive intracellular stores. Surprisingly we have found that a second independent signal is required to achieve dIgA-stimulated transcytosis of pIgR. This second signal depends on dIgA binding to the pIgR solely at the basolateral surface and the ability of pIgR to dimerize. This enables pIgR molecules that have bound dIgA at the basolateral surface to respond to the signal of stimulation once they reach the postmicrotubule compartment. We propose that the use of two signals may be a general mechanism by which signaling receptors maintain specificity along their signaling and trafficking pathways.},

We show that the critical function of ZFP64 in leukemia is to maintain MLL expression via binding to the MLL promoter, which is the most enriched location of ZFP64 occupancy in the human genome. The specificity of ZFP64 for MLL is accounted for by an exceptional density of ZFP64 motifs embedded within the MLL promoter.

In Hi-C experiments, it is believed that biases originating from different systematic deviations lead to extraneous variability among raw samples, and affect the reliability of downstream interpretations. As an important pipeline in Hi-C analysis, normalization seeks to remove the unwanted systematic biases; thus, a comparison between Hi-C normalization methods benefits their choice and the downstream analysis. In this article, a comprehensive comparison is proposed to investigate six Hi-C normalization methods in terms of multiple considerations. In light of comparison results, it has been shown that a cross-sample approach significantly outperforms individual sample methods in most considerations. The differences between these methods are analyzed, some practical recommendations are given, and the results are summarized in a table to facilitate the choice of the six normalization methods.

  abstract = {Cytokine-activated receptors undergo extracellular domain dimerization, which is necessary to activate intracellular signaling pathways. Here, we report that in prolactin (PRL)-treated cells, PRL receptor (PRLR) undergoes cytoplasmic loop dimerization that is acetylation-dependent. PRLR-recruited CREB-binding protein (CBP) acetylates multiple lysine sites randomly distributed along the cytoplasmic loop of PRLR. Two PRLR monomers appear to interact with each other at multiple parts from the membrane-proximal region to the membrane-distal region, relying on the coordination among multiple lysine sites neutralized via acetylation. Cytoplasmic loop-dimerized PRLR activates STAT5, which is also acetylated by CBP and undergoes acetylation-dependent dimerization. PRLR dimerization and subsequent signaling are enhanced by treating the cells with deacetylase sirtuin (SIRT) inhibitor nicotinamide or histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor trichostatin A but inhibited by expressing exogenous deacetylase SIRT2 or HDAC6. Our results suggest that acetylation and deacetylation provide the rheostat-like regulation for the cytokine receptor PRLR in its cytoplasmic loop dimerization and subsequent STAT5 activation.},

Functional studies using transfected THP-1 monocytic cells revealed the presence of a 56-bp LPS response element (LRE) within the TF promoter that conferred LPS responsiveness to a heterologous promoter. LPS stimulation of these cells activated proteins that bound to nucleotide sequences within the LRE resembling consensus binding sites for activator protein 1 (AP-1) and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B). Induction of the TF gene may represent a prototypic example of gene activation in monocytic cells by assembly of transcription factor complexes, and may clarify the role of AP-1 and NF-kappa B in the regulation of other LPS-responsive genes.},

  abstract = {Germinal centers develop in the B cell follicles of secondary lymphoid tissues during T cell-dependent (TD) antibody responses. The B cells that give rise to germinal centers initially have to be activated outside follicles, in the T cell-rich zones in association with interdigitating cells and T cell help. After immunization with a single dose of protein-based antigen, the germinal centers formed are oligoclonal; on average three B blasts colonize each follicle. These blasts undergo massive clonal expansion and activate a site-directed hypermutation mechanism that acts on their immunoglobulin-variable (Ig-v)-region genes. Mature germinal centers are divided into dark and light zones. The proliferating blasts, centroblasts, occupy the dark zone and give rise to centrocytes that are not in cell cycle and fill the light zone. The light zone contains a rich network of follicular dendritic cells (FDC) that have the capacity to take up antigen and hold this on their surface for periods of more than a year. The antigen is held as an immune complex in a native unprocessed form; but the antigen may be taken up from FDC by B cells, which can process this and present it to T cells. Centrocytes appear to be selected by their ability to interact with antigen held on FDC. There is a high death rate among centrocytes in vivo, and when these cells are isolated in vitro, they undergo apoptosis within hours on culture. The onset of apoptosis can be delayed by cross-linking centrocytes' surface Ig, and long-term survival is achieved by signalling through their surface CD40. After activation through CD40 the centrocytes increase their surface Ig and acquire characteristics of memory and processing of antigen held on FDC and its presentation to T cells that can be induced to express CD40 ligand at the point of cognate interaction. Other signals that induce a proportion of germinal center cells to become plasma cells have also been described. Germinal centers persist for about 3 weeks following immunization, but after this, memory B blasts continue to proliferate in follicles throughout the months of T cell-dependent antibody responses. These cells are probably the source of plasma cells and memory cells required to maintain long-term antibody production and memory after the first 3 weeks of T cell-dependent antibody responses.},

The survey comprised 252 consecutive human cell lines, almost exclusively tumor-derived, submitted by their originators to the DSMZ and 5 additional cell repositories (CRs), using a combination of DNA profiling (4-locus minisatellite and multilocus microsatellite probes) and molecular cytogenetics, exploiting an interactive database (http://www.dsmz.de/). Widespread high levels of cross-contaminants (CCs) were uncovered, affecting 45 cell lines (18\%) supplied by 27 of 93 originators (29\%). Unlike previous reports, most CCs (42/45) occurred intraspecies, a discrepancy attributable to improved detection of the more insidious intraspecies CCs afforded by molecular methods. The most prolific CCs were classic tumor cell lines, the numbers of CCs they caused being as follows: HeLa (n = 11), T-24 (n = 4), SK-HEP-1 (n = 4), U-937 (n = 4) and HT-29 (n = 3). All 5 supposed instances of spontaneous immortalization of normal cells were spurious, due to CLCC, including ECV304, the most cited human endothelial cell line. Although high, our figure for CCs at the source sets a lower limit only as (i) many older tumor cell lines were unavailable for comparison and (ii) circulating cell lines are often obtained indirectly, rather than via originators or CRs. The misidentified cell lines reported here have already been unwittingly used in several hundreds of potentially misleading reports, including use as inappropriate tumor models and subclones masquerading as independent replicates. We believe these findings indicate a grave and chronic problem demanding radical measures, to include extra controls over cell line authentication, provenance and availability.},

Surprisingly, 40\% of mice survived after the sole injection of avidin and biotin-labeled MB55–MB59, an observation consistent with the in vitro data showing that the miniantibodies induced killing of ∼25\% cells through antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity. In conclusion, MB55 and MB59 targeted to tumor cells represent a valuable tool to enhance the therapeutic effect of rituximab and other complement-fixing antitumor antibodies.

  abstract = {Background We have previously demonstrated that inhibition of CXCR4 in ALL decreases CXCR4 antibody binding, inhibits SDF-1α-(CXCL12)-induced chemotaxis, and overcomes chemotherapy resistance conferred by the bone marrow microenvironment. Specifically, we found that treatment with plerixafor and araC significantly decreased leukemic burden in a xenograft model of infant ALL, compared to treatment with araC alone. In those experiments, we treated mice on 3 consecutive days per week for 2 weeks with plerixafor and araC. However, the combination did not eradicate the leukemia in our model. We hypothesized that extended exposure to plerixafor may have led to increased interactions between surviving leukemic blasts and the bone marrow microenvironment. In our current experiments, we sought to characterize the effects of prolonged exposure to plerixafor in ALL. Methods/Results We treated pre-B (HB-1119, Nalm-6) and T (CCRF-CEM-1301, Jurkat) ALL cell lines with a dose range of plerixafor and harvested cells for FACS over an extended time course. We measured surface CXCR4 (s-CXCR4) expression using 3 antibodies: 12G5, which attaches to the SDF-1α and drug-binding site of CXCR4, and 1D9 and 2B11, which do not compete with SDF-1α or drug binding. 12G5 binding was decreased by plerixafor even at 1 hour and this effect was concentration-dependent. Interestingly, we found a time and dose-dependent increase in 1D9 and 2B11 antibody binding, suggesting that plerixafor caused an actual increase in s-CXCR4 over time. Increases in 1D9 and 2B11 binding were inversely proportional to decreases in 12G5 binding. We also measured surface expression of CD49d (VLA-4), which binds to fibronectin and VCAM-1; CXCR7, which binds to SDF-1α and CXCL11; and CXCR3, which binds to CXCL9, 10, and 11. We hypothesized that CXCR4 inhibition would lead to upregulation of parallel pathways of leukemia-stroma interactions. CD49d was highly expressed at baseline, while CXCR7 and CXCR3 were expressed to a lesser degree. Treatment with plerixafor led to dose-dependent increases in CXCR7 and variable changes in CD49d and CXCR3 surface expression, suggesting that plerixafor can modulate surface expression of adhesion molecules other than CXCR4.Next, we treated ALL cell lines with plerixafor (0, 10, 100 nM) for 72 hours, washed with PBS, and resuspended the cells in fresh medium to determine the effects of extended exposure to plerixafor and subsequent withdrawal. First, we measured surface expression of s-CXCR4 after 72 hours of treatment with plerixafor and found that 12G5 binding was decreased, while 1D9/2B11 binding was increased in an inversely proportional manner. After withdrawal, 12G5 binding increased to untreated levels between 4 and 24 hours, while 1D9/2B11 binding decreased to untreated levels between 4 and 72 hours. We also measured surface expression of CD49d, CXCR7, and CXCR3 and found that the effects of plerixafor treatment and withdrawal were variable by cell line. For example, after plerixafor treatment, surface expression of CD49d and CXCR7 was increased in Nalm-6 and surface expression of CXCR7 and CXCR3 was increased in CCRF-CEM-1301. Interestingly, 4 hours after plerixafor withdrawal, CD49d expression was increased in Jurkat and Nalm-6, and CXCR7 expression was increased in CCRF-CEM-1301, HB-1119, and Jurkat.Finally, we measured migration of washed cells from each treatment condition through a permeable membrane toward medium containing SDF-1α or medium alone. Despite CXCR4 inhibition for 72 hours, all plerixafor-treated cells migrated in response to SDF-1α. In addition, some plerixafor-treated cells exhibited significantly increased SDF-1α-induced chemotaxis compared to control-treated cells. These findings imply that increases in s-CXCR4 induced by 72 hours of treatment with plerixafor are functional. Conclusions Treatment of ALL cell lines with plerixafor led to a dose-dependent decrease in 12G5 antibody binding with a simultaneous overall increase in s-CXCR4 expression. Prolonged exposure to plerixafor led to increased s-CXCR4 expression that persisted for up to 72 hours after drug withdrawal, modulated surface expression of additional adhesion molecules, and enhanced SDF-1α-induced chemotaxis. Therefore, additional careful studies of CXCR4 inhibitors and other microenvironment-targeted agents must be performed in order to determine their optimal use in ALL.

The cellular and molecular mechanisms controlling haemoglobin switching have been intensively studied, but remain poorly understood. To study the developmental regulation of globin gene expression, we have produced transgenic mice in which cloned globin genes are present in erythroid cells throughout development. Recently, we reported that adult mice in several transgenic lines carrying a hybrid mouse/human adult beta-globin gene, expressed the gene in a correct tissue-specific manner. This finding raised the question of whether an exogenous globin gene could also be subject to appropriate stage-specific regulation. We report here that the hybrid beta-globin gene, like the endogenous adult beta-globin genes, is inactive in yolk sac-derived embryonic erythroid cells and is expressed for the first time in fetal liver erythroid cells. Our results indicate that a stage-specific pattern of expression can be conferred by cis-acting regulatory elements closely linked to an adult beta-globin gene. They also suggest that the embryonic and adult beta-globin genes in the mouse are activated (or repressed) by distinct trans-acting regulatory factors present in embryonic, fetal and adult erythroid cells.},

  abstract = {Back to TopAbstract Gene regulation relies on dynamic changes in three-dimensional chromatin conformation, which are shaped by composite regulatory and architectural elements. However, mechanisms that govern such conformational switches within chromosomal domains remain unknown. We identify a novel mechanism by which cis-elements promote long-range interactions, inducing conformational changes critical for diversification of the TCRβ antigen receptor locus (Tcrb). Association between distal Vβ gene segments and the highly expressed DβJβ clusters, termed the recombination center (RC), is independent of enhancer function and recruitment of V(D)J recombinase. Instead, we find that tissue-specific folding of Tcrb relies on two distinct architectural elements located upstream of the RC. The first, a CTCF-containing element, directly tethers distal portions of the Vβ array to the RC. The second element is a chromatin barrier that protects the tether from hyperactive RC chromatin. When the second element is removed, active RC chromatin spreads upstream, forcing the tether to serve as a new barrier. Acquisition of barrier function by the CTCF element disrupts contacts between distal Vβ gene segments and significantly alters Tcrb repertoires. Our findings reveal a separation of function for RC-flanking regions, in which anchors for long-range recombination must be cordoned off from hyperactive RC landscapes by chromatin barriers.},

Here we engineer this system to enable RNA-guided genome regulation in human cells by tethering transcriptional activation domains either directly to a nuclease-null Cas9 protein or to an aptamer-modified single guide RNA (sgRNA). Using this functionality we developed a transcriptional activation–based assay to determine the landscape of off-target binding of sgRNA:Cas9 complexes and compared it with the off-target activity of transcription activator–like (TALs) effectors. Our results reveal that specificity profiles are sgRNA dependent, and that sgRNA:Cas9 complexes and 18-mer TAL effectors can potentially tolerate 1–3 and 1–2 target mismatches, respectively. By engineering a requirement for cooperativity through offset nicking for genome editing or through multiple synergistic sgRNAs for robust transcriptional activation, we suggest methods to mitigate off-target phenomena. Our results expand the versatility of the sgRNA:Cas9 tool and highlight the critical need to engineer improved specificity.},

  abstract = {IDEC-C2B8 is a chimeric monoclonal antibody (MoAb) directed against the B-cell–specific antigen CD20 expressed on non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL). The MoAb mediates complement and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity and has direct antiproliferative effects against malignant B-cell lines in vitro. Phase I trials of single doses up to 500 mg/m2 and 4 weekly doses of 375 mg/m2 showed clinical responses with no dose-limiting toxicity. We conducted a phase II, multicenter study evaluating four weekly infusions of 375 mg/m2 IDEC-C2B8 in patients with relapsed low-grade or follicular NHL (Working Formulation groups A-D). Patients were monitored for adverse events, antibody pharmacokinetics, and clinical response. Thirty-seven patients with a median age of 58 years (range, 29 to 81 years) were treated. All patients had relapsed after chemotherapy (median of 2 prior regimens) and 54\% had failed aggressive chemotherapy. Infusional side effects (grade 1-2) consisting of mild fever, chills, respiratory symptoms, and occasionally hypotension were observed mostly with the initial antibody infusion and were rare with subsequent doses. Peripheral blood B-cell depletion occurred rapidly, with recovery beginning 6 months posttreatment. There were no significant changes in mean IgG levels and infections were not increased over what would be expected in this population. Clinical remissions were observed in 17 patients (3 complete remissions and 14 partial remissions), yielding an intent to treat response rate of 46\%. The onset of these tumor responses was as soon as 1 month posttreatment and reached a maximum by 4 months posttreatment. In the 17 responders, the median time to progression was 10.2 months (5 patients exceeding 20 months). Likelihood of tumor response was associated with a follicular histology, with the ability to sustain a high serum level of antibody after the first infusion, and with a longer duration of remission to prior chemotherapy. One patient developed a detectable but not quantifiable immune response to the antibody that had no clinical significance. IDEC-C2B8 in a dose of 375 mg/m2 weekly for 4 weeks has antitumor activity in patients with relapsed low-grade or follicular NHL. Results with this brief, outpatient treatment compare favorably with results with standard chemotherapy, and IDEC-C2B8 has a better safety profile. Further studies evaluating IDEC-C2B8 in other types of lymphoma either alone or combined with chemotherapy are warranted.},

  abstract = {Interleukin-24 (IL-24) is a cytokine encoded by a tumor suppressor gene of the IL-10 family, also known as the melanoma differentiation associated gene-7 (Mda-7) and first discovered in human melanoma cells. Mda-7/IL-24 has been shown to inhibit the proliferation of various human tumor cell lines, but its effect on the sensitivity of B cell lymphoma to chemotherapy agents is not yet clear. The present study investigated the effects of Mda-7/IL-24 overexpression on the sensitivity of human B cell lymphoma cells to chemotherapy, as well as its mechanism of action. The sensitivity of stable Mda-7/IL-24 overexpressing Raji and Daudi cells to cis-diamminedichloroplatinum (CDDP), epirubicin and vinblastine (VCR) were assessed by the MTS method, and the IC50 value calculated. Cell apoptosis and the intracellular accumulation of Rhodamine-123 were assayed by flow cytometry. The expression of multidrug resistance gene 1 (MDR1), B-cell-specific Moloney murine leukemia virus insertion site 1 (BMI1), topoisomerase II (Topo II) and multidrug resistance-related protein 1 (MRP1) mRNA and protein were analyzed by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and western blotting, respectively. In addition, western blot analysis was also used to investigate the effect of Mda-7/IL-24 on activity of GTP-RhoA-ERK signaling pathway in Raji and Daudi cells. Growth inhibition and apoptosis rates of Mda-7/IL-24 overexpressing Raji and Daudi cells were higher than those of non-transfected cells and cells transfected with vector alone when treated with CDDP, epirubicin and VCR. The IC50 values of CDDP, epirubicin and VCR were lower for Mda-7/IL-24-overexpressing Raji and Daudi cells than for non-transfected cells and cells transfected with empty vector. Intracellular accumulation of Rhodamine-123 and the expression of Topo II were higher, while the levels of MDR1, BMI and MRP1 mRNA and protein were lower, in Mda-7/IL-24 overexpressing Raji and Daudi cells. Furthermore, the activities of GTP-RhoA-ERK signaling pathway in Raji and Daudi cells were suppressed. These results indicated that Mda-7/IL-24 enhanced the sensitivity of B lymphoma cells to chemotherapy agents by altering the expression of multidrug-resistance genes via downregulating GTP-RhoA-ERK signaling pathway, suggesting that treatment of B cell lymphomas with Mda-7/IL-24 could avoid MDR.},

  abstract = {Deregulated transcriptional control caused by aberrant DNA methylation and/or histone modifications is a hallmark of cancer cells. In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), the most common adult leukemia, the epigenetic ‘landscape’ has added a new layer of complexity to our understanding of this clinically and biologically heterogeneous disease. Early studies identified aberrant DNA methylation, often based on single gene promoter analysis with both biological and clinical impact. Subsequent genome-wide profiling studies revealed differential DNA methylation between CLLs and controls and in prognostics subgroups of the disease. From these studies, it became apparent that DNA methylation in regions outside of promoters, such as enhancers, is important for the regulation of coding genes as well as for the regulation of non-coding RNAs. Although DNA methylation profiles are reportedly stable over time and in relation to therapy, a higher epigenetic heterogeneity or ‘burden’ is seen in more aggressive CLL subgroups, albeit as non-recurrent ‘passenger’ events. More recently, DNA methylation profiles in CLL analyzed in relation to differentiating normal B-cell populations revealed that the majority of the CLL epigenome reflects the epigenomes present in the cell of origin and that only a small fraction of the epigenetic alterations represents truly CLL-specific changes. Furthermore, CLL patients can be grouped into at least three clinically relevant epigenetic subgroups, potentially originating from different cells at various stages of differentiation and associated with distinct outcomes. In this review, we summarize the current understanding of the DNA methylome in CLL, the role of histone modifying enzymes, highlight insights derived from animal models and attempts made to target epigenetic regulators in CLL along with the future directions of this rapidly advancing field.},

Most currently available vaccines rely on the induction of long-lived protective humoral immune responses by memory B cells and plasma cells, underscoring the importance of Abs in host protection. Ab responses against most antigens (Ags) require interactions between B cells and CD4+ T helper cells, and it is now well recognized that T follicular helper cells (Tfh) specialize in providing cognate help to B cells and are fundamentally required for the generation of T cell–dependent B cell responses. Perturbations in the development and/or function of Tfh cells can manifest as immunopathologies, such as immunodeficiency, autoimmunity, and malignancy. Unraveling the cellular and molecular requirements underlying Tfh cell formation and maintenance will help to identify molecules that could be targeted for the treatment of immunological diseases that are characterized by insufficient or excessive Ab responses.},

While many protocols have been optimized for optimal cell yield, they have often overlooked the effects that dissociation can have on ex vivo gene expression. Here, we demonstrate that use of enzymatic dissociation on brain tissue induces an aberrant ex vivo gene expression signature, most prominently in microglia, which is prevalent in published literature and can substantially confound downstream analyses. To address this issue, we present a rigorously validated protocol that preserves both in vivo transcriptional profiles and cell-type diversity and yield across tissue types and species. We also identify a similar signature in postmortem human brain single-nucleus RNA-sequencing datasets, and show that this signature is induced in freshly isolated human tissue by exposure to elevated temperatures ex vivo. Together, our results provide a methodological solution for preventing artifactual gene expression changes during fresh tissue digestion and a reference for future deeper analysis of the potential confounding states present in postmortem human samples.},

  abstract = {The epigenetic landscape undergoes a widespread modulation during embryonic development and cell differentiation. Within the hematopoietic system, B cells are perhaps the cell lineage with a more dynamic DNA methylome during their maturation process, which involves approximately one third of all the CpG sites of the genome. Although each B-cell maturation step displays its own DNA methylation fingerprint, the DNA methylome is more extensively modified in particular maturation transitions. These changes are gradually accumulated in specific chromatin environments as cell differentiation progresses and reflect different features and functional states of B cells. Promoters and enhancers of B-cell transcription factors acquire activation-related epigenetic marks and are sequentially expressed in particular maturation windows. These transcription factors further reconfigure the epigenetic marks and activity state of their target sites to regulate the expression of genes related to B-cell functions. Together with this observation, extensive DNA methylation changes in areas outside gene regulatory elements such as hypomethylation of heterochromatic regions and hypermethylation of CpG-rich regions, also take place in mature B cells, which intriguingly have been described as hallmarks of cancer. This process starts in germinal center B cells, a highly proliferative cell type, and becomes particularly apparent in long-lived cells such as memory and plasma cells. Overall, the characterization of the DNA methylome during B-cell differentiation not only provides insights into the complex epigenetic network of regulatory elements that mediate the maturation process but also suggests that late B cells also passively accumulate epigenetic changes related to cell proliferation and longevity.},

These include the capacities to proliferate independently of exogenous growth-promoting or growth-inhibitory signals, to invade surrounding tissues and metastasize to distant sites, to elicit an angiogenic response, and to evade mechanisms that limit cell proliferation, such as apoptosis and replicative senescence. These properties reflect alterations in the cellular signaling pathways that in normal cells control cell proliferation, motility, and survival.

Here, we report that NCoR has a tumor-suppressive role, inhibiting extravasation, metastasis formation, and tumor growth in mice. These changes are related to repressed transcription of genes associated with increased metastasis and poor prognosis in cancer patients. An autoregulatory loop maintains NCoR gene expression, suggesting that NCoR loss can be propagated, contributing to tumor progression in the absence of NCoR gene mutations. The nuclear receptor thyroid hormone receptor β1 increases NCoR expression, and this induction is essential in mediating its tumor-suppressive actions. Both are reduced in human hepatocarcinoma and aggressive breast cancer tumors, identifying NCoR as a potential molecular target for the development of novel therapies., Nuclear corepressor 1 (NCoR) associates with nuclear receptors and other transcription factors leading to transcriptional repression. We show here that NCoR depletion enhances cancer cell invasion and increases tumor growth and metastatic potential in nude mice. These changes are related to repressed transcription of genes associated with increased metastasis and poor prognosis in patients. Strikingly, transient NCoR silencing leads to heterochromatinization and stable silencing of the NCoR gene, suggesting that NCoR loss can be propagated, contributing to tumor progression even in the absence of NCoR gene mutations. Down-regulation of the thyroid hormone receptor β1 (TRβ) appears to be associated with cancer onset and progression. We found that expression of TRβ increases NCoR levels and that this induction is essential in mediating inhibition of tumor growth and metastasis by this receptor. Moreover, NCoR is down-regulated in human hepatocarcinomas and in the more aggressive breast cancer tumors, and its expression correlates positively with that of TRβ. These data provide a molecular basis for the anticancer actions of this corepressor and identify NCoR as a potential molecular target for development of novel cancer therapies.},

  abstract = {Nonstructural protein 5A (NS5A) of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) possesses multiple and diverse functions in RNA replication, interferon resistance, and viral pathogenesis. Recent studies suggest that NS5A is involved in the assembly and maturation of infectious viral particles; however, precisely how NS5A participates in virus production has not been fully elucidated. In the present study, we demonstrate that NS5A is a prerequisite for HCV particle production as a result of its interaction with the viral capsid protein (core protein). The efficiency of virus production correlated well with the levels of interaction between NS5A and the core protein. Alanine substitutions for the C-terminal serine cluster in domain III of NS5A (amino acids 2428, 2430, and 2433) impaired NS5A basal phosphorylation, leading to a marked decrease in NS5A-core interaction, disturbance of the subcellular localization of NS5A, and disruption of virion production. Replacing the same serine cluster with glutamic acid, which mimics the presence of phosphoserines, partially preserved the NS5A-core interaction and virion production, suggesting that phosphorylation of these serine residues is important for virion production. In addition, we found that the alanine substitutions in the serine cluster suppressed the association of the core protein with viral genome RNA, possibly resulting in the inhibition of nucleocapsid assembly. These results suggest that NS5A plays a key role in regulating the early phase of HCV particle formation by interacting with core protein and that its C-terminal serine cluster is a determinant of the NS5A-core interaction.},

  abstract = {Predicting progression in a T cell lymphoma Mycosis fungoides (MF) is an often indolent cutaneous T cell lymphoma identifiable by the T cell receptor gene TCRB in skin biopsies. de Masson et al. performed high-throughput sequencing of MF skin lesions to determine whether the frequency of the most abundant TCRB sequence could predict the fraction of cases that progress to more aggressive disease. This tumor clone frequency (TCF) outperformed commonly used prognostic indicators of disease progression and overall survival in MF, and was particularly useful in early-stage disease. The TCF may thus help identify which MF patients in the same clinical disease stage are in fact more likely to progress to life-threatening disease. Mycosis fungoides (MF), the most common cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL) is a malignancy of skin-tropic memory T cells. Most MF cases present as early stage (stage I A/B, limited to the skin), and these patients typically have a chronic, indolent clinical course. However, a small subset of early-stage cases develop progressive and fatal disease. Because outcomes can be so different, early identification of this high-risk population is an urgent unmet clinical need. We evaluated the use of next-generation high-throughput DNA sequencing of the T cell receptor β gene (TCRB) in lesional skin biopsies to predict progression and survival in a discovery cohort of 208 patients with CTCL (177 with MF) from a 15-year longitudinal observational clinical study. We compared these data to the results in an independent validation cohort of 101 CTCL patients (87 with MF). The tumor clone frequency (TCF) in lesional skin, measured by high-throughput sequencing of the TCRB gene, was an independent prognostic factor of both progression-free and overall survival in patients with CTCL and MF in particular. In early-stage patients, a TCF of {$>$}25\% in the skin was a stronger predictor of progression than any other established prognostic factor (stage IB versus IA, presence of plaques, high blood lactate dehydrogenase concentration, large-cell transformation, or age). The TCF therefore may accurately predict disease progression in early-stage MF. Early identification of patients at high risk for progression could help identify candidates who may benefit from allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation before their disease becomes treatment-refractory. The malignant T cell clone frequency in cutaneous T cell lymphoma lesions is an independent prognostic indicator for early disease progression and death. The malignant T cell clone frequency in cutaneous T cell lymphoma lesions is an independent prognostic indicator for early disease progression and death.},

  abstract = {Light- and dark-zone death dynamics Germinal centers (GCs) are areas within lymphoid organs where mature B cells expand and differentiate during normal immune responses. GCs are separated into two anatomic compartments: the dark zone, where B cells divide and undergo somatic hypermutation, and the light zone, where they are selected for affinity-enhancing mutations after interacting with T follicular helper cells. Mayer et al. studied apoptosis reporter mice and found that both GC zones experience very high rates of apoptosis (see the Perspective by Bryant and Hodgkin). However, the underlying mechanisms were distinct and microanatomically segregated. Light-zo ne B cells underwent apoptosis by default unless they were rescued by positive selection. In contrast, apoptotic dark-zone B cells were highly enriched among cells with genes damaged by random antibody-gene mutations. Science, this issue p. eaao2602; see also p. 171 Structured Abstract INTRODUCTIONGerminal centers (GCs) are transient microanatomic structures that form in lymphoid organs during an immune response. They are the sites of B cell clonal expansion and affinity maturation, a process that leads to the production of high-affinity antibodies. GCs are highly dynamic and contain activated B cells, specialized T follicular helper (TFH) cells, and antigen-trapping follicular dendritic cells. GCs are organized into two functionally distinct compartments: a dark zone (DZ) and a light zone (LZ). The DZ is the site of rapid cell division and random antibody-gene mutation, which is initiated by activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID). The mutation process leads to the accumulation of a large number of closely related B cells that carry receptors with distinct antigen-binding properties. Once they stop dividing, DZ B cells migrate to the LZ, where their newly generated B cell receptors (BCRs) are tested: GC B cells with relatively higher-affinity receptors capture and process more antigen, leading to positive selection by interaction with TFH cells. The positively selected LZ B cells return to the DZ, where they undergo further cycles of division and mutation. Concomitantly, small numbers of memory B cells and antibody-secreting plasma cells exit the GC. Together, these processes provide the mechanistic basis for affinity maturation, which is essential for effective vaccination and protection from infections. RATIONALEIn addition to producing antibody variants, AID expression is also a threat to the genome. AID can produce double-strand breaks that are substrates for chromosome translocations. It can also produce immunoglobulin (Ig) gene missense mutations and deletions or create self-reactive antibodies. These deleterious mutations need to be selected against. Indeed, histologists have long appreciated large numbers of apoptotic nuclei in the specialized tingible body macrophages found in GCs. However, beyond histology, little is known about the exact rate of GC B cell apoptosis and whether it differs in the DZ and LZ of the GC. Moreover, the mechanisms that cause apoptosis, their relative importance in each GC compartment, and their role in GC B cell selection have not been defined. To examine these questions, we created fluorescent apoptosis-indicator mice and used them to enumerate, isolate, and characterize dying cells in the GC. RESULTSWe found that apoptosis is prevalent in both the DZ and LZ compartments of GCs throughout the immune response: up to 50\% of GC B cells undergo programmed cell death every 6 hours. Single dying GC B cells were isolated, and their antibody genes were cloned, expressed by transient transfection, and tested for antigen binding and other properties. Apoptotic DZ cells were highly enriched for Ig genes damaged by AID, including missense mutations and deletions. By contrast, dying LZ cells primarily expressed intact antibodies with a range of affinities indistinguishable from GC B cells in the live LZ compartment. By experimentally blocking positive selection and by using reporter mice for Myc, a proto-oncogene, as an indicator of positive selection, we found that apoptosis is the default fate for LZ GC B cells that are not actively positively selected. Thus, LZ GC B cells carrying low-affinity BCRs do not preferentially undergo apoptosis. Instead, apoptosis occurs irrespective of BCR-affinity, and LZ B cells carrying high-affinity BCRs are simply more likely to be positively selected. CONCLUSIONApoptosis is a major feature of GC B cell biology and is required to counterbalance the high rate of proliferation and purge B cells that carry deleterious mutations. Although apoptosis occurs in both the DZ and LZ, the underlying mechanisms of apoptosis in each zone are distinct and microanatomically segregated. These insights into GC B biology are relevant for vaccine design, particularly for pathogens that normally evade effective antibody responses. {$<$}img class="fragment-image" src="https://d2ufo47lrtsv5s.cloudfront.net/content/sci/358/6360/eaao2602/F1.medium.gif"/{$>$} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Germinal center B cells expressing an apoptosis indicator.Intravital two-photon microscopy of GC B cells in popliteal lymph nodes of immunized mice (GC B cells, yellow and green; follicular dendritic cell networks, red). The fluorescence resonance energy transfer–based INDIA reporter was used to visualize and purify dying GC B cells. B cells undergo rapid cell division and affinity maturation in anatomically distinct sites in lymphoid organs called germinal centers (GCs). Homeostasis is maintained in part by B cell apoptosis. However, the precise contribution of apoptosis to GC biology and selection is not well defined. We developed apoptosis-indicator mice and used them to visualize, purify, and characterize dying GC B cells. Apoptosis is prevalent in the GC, with up to half of all GC B cells dying every 6 hours. Moreover, programmed cell death is differentially regulated in the light zone and the dark zone: Light-zone B cells die by default if they are not positively selected, whereas dark-zone cells die when their antigen receptors are damaged by activation-induced cytidine deaminase. The selection of germinal center B cells by apoptosis is regulated by microanatomically distinct mechanisms. The selection of germinal center B cells by apoptosis is regulated by microanatomically distinct mechanisms.},

  abstract = {Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most lethal human cancers and shows resistance to any therapeutic strategy used. Here we tested small-molecule inhibitors targeting chromatin regulators as possible therapeutic agents in PDAC. We show that JQ1, an inhibitor of the bromodomain and extraterminal (BET) family of proteins, suppresses PDAC development in mice by inhibiting both MYC activity and inflammatory signals. The histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor SAHA synergizes with JQ1 to augment cell death and more potently suppress advanced PDAC. Finally, using a CRISPR-Cas9–based method for gene editing directly in the mouse adult pancreas, we show that de-repression of p57 (also known as KIP2 or CDKN1C) upon combined BET and HDAC inhibition is required for the induction of combination therapy–induced cell death in PDAC. SAHA is approved for human use, and molecules similar to JQ1 are being tested in clinical trials. Thus, these studies identify a promising epigenetic-based therapeutic strategy that may be rapidly implemented in fatal human tumors.},

  abstract = {PurposeBurkitt lymphoma (BL) is a B-cell lymphoma frequently diagnosed in children. It is characterized by MYC translocations, which lead to the constitutive expression of the MYC oncogene. MYC contributes to miR-29 repression through an E-box MYC binding site on the miR-29b-1/miR-29a promoter region. We evaluated the role of miR-29a/b/c and their predicted targets in BL pathogenesis.MethodsMature sequences of miR-29a/b/c were transfected to the BL cell lines BL41 and Raji, and evaluated for DNMT3B, MCL1, BIM, CDK6, AKT and TCL1 protein expression as well as for MCL-1 and CDK6 mRNA expression. BL cells were treated with 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine (decitabine) and evaluated for miR29 expressions and methylation status. DNMT3B inhibition was performed by DNMT3B siRNA.ResultsEctopic expression of miR-29s in BL cells decreased CDK6, DNMT3B, TCL1 and MCL-1 protein levels, but CDK6 and MCL-1 mRNA expression was unaffected by miR-29. Decitabine enhanced miR-29 expression levels and decreased CDK6 protein expression. Additionally, inhibition of DNMT3B by siRNA increased miR-29a/b expression. Notably, the miR-29a/b1 and miR-29b2/c promoter genes showed methylated CpG sequences that were demethylated after decitabine treatments. Furthermore, MYC-negative tumours had higher levels of miR-29 expression compared with MYC-translocated cases, suggesting that MYC regulates miR-29 in BL tumours.ConclusionsOur results suggest a significant role for miR-29s in BL pathogenesis in altering the expression of targets involved in critical cancer pathways, such as cell cycle control, apoptosis inhibition and DNA methylation. Moreover, methylation-mediated miR-29 epigenetic silencing may occur during BL development.},

This array supersedes the widely used Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip, which has permitted insights into the relationship between DNA methylation and a wide range of conditions and traits. Previous research has identified issues with certain probes on both the HumanMethylation450 BeadChip and its predecessor, the Infinium HumanMethylation27 BeadChip, which were predicted to affect array performance. These issues concerned probe-binding specificity and the presence of polymorphisms at target sites.

  abstract = {Helper T (Th) cell–regulated B cell immunity progresses in an ordered cascade of cellular development that culminates in the production of antigen-specific memory B cells. The recognition of peptide MHC class II complexes on activated antigen-presenting cells is critical for effective Th cell selection, clonal expansion, and effector Th cell function development (Phase I). Cognate effector Th cell–B cell interactions then promote the development of either short-lived plasma cells (PCs) or germinal centers (GCs) (Phase II). These GCs expand, diversify, and select high-affinity variants of antigen-specific B cells for entry into the long-lived memory B cell compartment (Phase III). Upon antigen rechallenge, memory B cells rapidly expand and differentiate into PCs under the cognate control of memory Th cells (Phase IV). We review the cellular and molecular regulators of this dynamic process with emphasis on the multiple memory B cell fates that develop in vivo.},

  abstract = {Next-generation DNA sequencing (NGS) projects, such as the 1000 Genomes Project, are already revolutionizing our understanding of genetic variation among individuals. However, the massive data sets generated by NGS—the 1000 Genome pilot alone includes nearly five terabases—make writing feature-rich, efficient, and robust analysis tools difficult for even computationally sophisticated individuals. Indeed, many professionals are limited in the scope and the ease with which they can answer scientific questions by the complexity of accessing and manipulating the data produced by these machines. Here, we discuss our Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK), a structured programming framework designed to ease the development of efficient and robust analysis tools for next-generation DNA sequencers using the functional programming philosophy of MapReduce. The GATK provides a small but rich set of data access patterns that encompass the majority of analysis tool needs. Separating specific analysis calculations from common data management infrastructure enables us to optimize the GATK framework for correctness, stability, and CPU and memory efficiency and to enable distributed and shared memory parallelization. We highlight the capabilities of the GATK by describing the implementation and application of robust, scale-tolerant tools like coverage calculators and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) calling. We conclude that the GATK programming framework enables developers and analysts to quickly and easily write efficient and robust NGS tools, many of which have already been incorporated into large-scale sequencing projects like the 1000 Genomes Project and The Cancer Genome Atlas.},

  abstract = {We characterized the enhancer landscape of 66 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), identifying 6 novel subgroups and their associated regulatory loci. These subgroups are defined by their superenhancer (SE) maps, orthogonal to somatic mutations, and are associated with distinct leukemic cell states. Examination of transcriptional drivers for these epigenomic subtypes uncovers a subset of patients with a particularly strong SE at the retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARA) gene locus. The presence of a RARA SE and concomitant high levels of RARA mRNA predisposes cell lines and ex vivo models to exquisite sensitivity to a selective agonist of RARα, SY-1425 (tamibarotene). Furthermore, only AML patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models with high RARA mRNA were found to respond to SY-1425. Mechanistically, we show that the response to SY-1425 in RARA-high AML cells is similar to that of acute promyelocytic leukemia treated with retinoids, characterized by the induction of known retinoic acid response genes, increased differentiation, and loss of proliferation. Significance: We use the SE landscape of primary human AML to elucidate transcriptional circuitry and identify novel cancer vulnerabilities. A subset of patients were found to have an SE at RARA, which is predictive for response to SY-1425, a potent and selective RARα agonist, in preclinical models, forming the rationale for its clinical investigation in biomarker-selected patients.

The analysis of these neonates revealed a lack of mature macrophages, neutrophils, B cells and T cells, although erythrocytes and megakaryocytes were present. The absence of lymphoid commitment and development in null mice was not absolute, since mice maintained on antibiotics began to develop normal appearing T cells 3-5 days after birth. In contrast, mature B cells remained undetectable in these older mice. Within the myeloid lineage, despite a lack of macrophages in the older antibiotic-treated animals, a few cells with the characteristics of neutrophils began to appear by day 3.

  abstract = {PURPOSE The CD20 antigen is expressed on more than 90\% of B-cell lymphomas. It is appealing for targeted therapy, because it does not shed or modulate. A chimeric monoclonal antibody more effectively mediates host effector functions and is itself less immunogenic than are murine antibodies. PATIENTS AND METHODS This was a multiinstitutional trial of the chimeric anti-CD20 antibody, IDEC-C2B8. Patients with relapsed low grade or follicular lymphoma received an outpatient treatment course of IDEC-C2B8 375 mg/m2 intravenously weekly for four doses. RESULTS From 31 centers, 166 patients were entered. Of this intent-to-treat group, 48\% responded. With a median follow-up duration of 11.8 months, the projected median time to progression for responders is 13.0 months. Serum antibody levels were sustained longer after the fourth infusion than after the first, and were higher in responders and in patients with lower tumor burden. The majority of adverse events occurred during the first infusion and were grade 1 or 2; fever and chills were the most common events. Only 12\% of patients had grade 3 and 3\% grade 4 toxicities. A human antichimeric antibody was detected in only one patient. CONCLUSION The response rate of 48\% with IDEC-C2B8 is comparable to results with single-agent cytotoxic chemotherapy. Toxicity was mild. Attention needs to be paid to the rate of antibody infusion, with titration according to toxicity. Further investigation of this agent is warranted, including its use in conjunction with standard chemotherapy.},

Though largely specific for immunoglobulin genes, AID also acts on a limited set of off-targets, generating oncogenic translocations and mutations that contribute to B cell lymphoma. How AID is recruited to off-targets has been a long-standing mystery. Based on deep GRO-seq studies of mouse and human B lineage cells activated for CSR or SHM, we report that most robust AID off-target translocations occur within highly focal regions of target genes in which sense and antisense transcription converge. Moreover, we found that such AID-targeting~“convergent” transcription arises from antisense transcription that emanates from super-enhancers within sense transcribed gene bodies. Our findings provide an explanation for AID off-targeting to a small subset of mostly lineage-specific genes in activated B cells.},

  abstract = {Genomes of complex organisms encode an abundance and diversity of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) that are expressed throughout the cell and fulfill a wide variety of regulatory roles at almost every stage of gene expression. These roles, which encompass sensory, guiding, scaffolding and allosteric capacities, derive from folded modular domains in lncRNAs. In this diverse functional repertoire, we focus on the well-characterized ability for lncRNAs to function as epigenetic modulators. Many lncRNAs bind to chromatin-modifying proteins and recruit their catalytic activity to specific sites in the genome, thereby modulating chromatin states and impacting gene expression. Considering this regulatory potential in combination with the abundance of lncRNAs suggests that lncRNAs may be part of a broad epigenetic regulatory network.},

The PowerPlex 1.1/Amelogenin System supports simultaneous amplification of eight short tandem repeat loci and the Amelogenin gender identification marker. The loci D16S539, D7S820, D13S317, and D5S818 are labeled with fluorescein (FL) while the loci CSF1PO, TP0X, TH01, vWA and Amelogenin are labeled with carboxy-tetramethylrhodamine (TMR). The FFFL Multiplex System is composed of the loci F13A01, FESFPS, F13B, and LPL, each labeled with fluorescein. We have observed no overlap of alleles across loci labeled with an individual fluorescent dye. Samples of each system were amplified and labeled in a single reaction, separated by electrophoresis through a denaturing polyacrylamide gel, and amplified alleles detected using a Hitachi FMBIO Fluorescent Scanner. Alterations from the standard amplification protocols in cycle number and annealing temperature generally produced excellent results. In experiments testing sensitivity as little as 0.2 ng of DNA template could be detected. As expected, different body fluids from the same individuals generated identical DNA profile results. Template DNA derived from blood-strains deposited on a variety of matrix supports displayed robust amplification except for material derived from deposits on wood and Japanese orchid leaves. Mixtures of DNA templates could be interpreted with the minor component present in as little as ten percent of the total sample. Monoplex and multiplex amplifications produced identical amplified allele patterns, indicating that STR multiplex systems save template and increase efficiency in the amplification procedure without loss of quality. Analyses of genotype frequencies in African-American, Caucasian-American and Hispanic-American populations using all twelve loci were used to determine matching probabilities smaller than 1 in 1.14 x 10(8) and 1 in 2658 for the PowerPlex 1.1 and the FFFL Multiplex Systems, respectively. The matching probability achieved with the two systems combined is smaller than 1 in 3.03 x 10(11). The independence of alleles within loci was generally demonstrated by applying the exact test to demonstrate Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium. All of the studies performed indicate that the PowerPlex 1.1/Amelogenin and FFFL Multiplex Systems are powerful, robust, and reliable investigative tools that can be used in the analysis of forensic samples.},

Transcriptionally active genes contact enhancer-like elements, whereas transcriptionally inactive genes interact with previously uncharacterized elements marked by repressive features that may act as long-range silencers. Finally, we show that interacting loci are enriched for disease-associated SNPs, suggesting how distal mutations may disrupt the regulation of relevant genes.

  abstract = {Polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR) plays an important role in mucosal immune systems. Secretory immunoglobulin A, composed of secretory component of pIgR and a dimeric form of immunoglobulin A, is secreted on mucosal surfaces and serves as a biological defense factor. pIgR gene expression is reportedly induced by activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor (NF)-κB. On the other hand, secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (SLPI) is a glycoprotein that functions as a serine protease inhibitor. In alveolar epithelial cells, SLPI increases the level of IκBβ, which indicates that it is an inhibitor of NF-κB at the protein level. Taken together, SLPI may regulate pIgR expression; however, the specific mechanism by which this occurs is unclear. Therefore, the aim of this study was to elucidatethe influence of SLPI on pIgR expression.SLPI and pIgR localized in goblet cells and ciliated epithelial cells of the gastrointestinal tract, respectively. No cells were detected in which SLPI and pIgR were co-expressed. In addition, recombinant human SLPI stimulation of an epithelial cell line (HT-29) decreased the pIgR expression. The pIgR expression was also higher in SLPI-deficient Ca9-22 cells than in wild-type Ca9-22 cells. Furthermore, a luciferase assay using a NF-κB reporter plasmid and real-time RT-PCR analysis indicated that when SLPI was present, the transcriptional activity of NF-κB protein was suppressed, which was accompanied by anincrease in the protein, but not the mRNA,expression of IκBβ. These results demonstrate that SLPI down-regulates pIgR expression through the NF-κB signaling pathway by inhibiting degradation of IκBβ protein.},

  abstract = {Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a newly identified betacoronavirus causing high morbidity and mortality in humans. The coronavirus spike (S) protein is the main determinant of viral entry, and although it was previously shown that MERS-CoV S can be activated by various proteases, the details of the mechanisms of proteolytic activation of fusion are still incompletely characterized. Here, we have uncovered distinctive characteristics of MERS-CoV S. We identify, by bioinformatics and peptide cleavage assays, two cleavage sites for furin, a ubiquitously expressed protease, which are located at the S1/S2 interface and at the S2′ position of the S protein. We show that although the S1/S2 site is proteolytically processed by furin during protein biosynthesis, the S2′ site is cleaved upon viral entry. MERS-CoV pseudovirion infection was shown to be enhanced by elevated levels of furin expression, and entry could be decreased by furin siRNA silencing. Enhanced furin activity appeared to partially override the low pH-dependent nature of MERS-CoV entry. Inhibition of furin activity was shown to decrease MERS-CoV S-mediated entry, as well as infection by the virus. Overall, we show that MERS-CoV has evolved an unusual two-step furin activation for fusion, suggestive of a role during the process of emergence into the human population. The ability of MERS-CoV to use furin in this manner, along with other proteases, may explain the polytropic nature of the virus.},

  abstract = {The inactive X chromosome (Xi) serves as a model to understand gene silencing on a global scale. Here, we perform “identification of direct RNA interacting proteins” (iDRiP) to isolate a comprehensive protein interactome for Xist, an RNA required for Xi silencing. We discover multiple classes of interactors—including cohesins, condensins, topoisomerases, RNA helicases, chromatin remodelers, and modifiers—that synergistically repress Xi transcription. Inhibiting two or three interactors destabilizes silencing. Although Xist attracts some interactors, it repels architectural factors. Xist evicts cohesins from the Xi and directs an Xi-specific chromosome conformation. Upon deleting Xist, the Xi acquires the cohesin-binding and chromosomal architecture of the active X. Our study unveils many layers of Xi repression and demonstrates a central role for RNA in the topological organization of mammalian chromosomes. INTRODUCTION The mammal has evolved an epigenetic mechanism to silence one of two X chromosomes in the XX female to equalize gene dosages with the XY male. Once established, the inactivated X chromosome (Xi) is extremely stable and is maintained through the lifetime of the female mammal. The principal regulator, Xist, is a long noncoding RNA that orchestrates the silencing process along the Xi. Xist is believed to operate as a scaffold to recruit and spread repressive complexes, such as Polycomb Repressive Complex 2, along the X chromosome. The identities of crucial interacting factors, however, have remained largely unknown. RATIONALE Although the Xi’s epigenetic stability is a necessary homeostatic property, an ability to unlock this epigenetic state is of great current interest. The X chromosome is home to nearly 1000 genes, at least 50 of which have been implicated in X-linked diseases, such as Rett syndrome and fragile X syndrome. The Xi is therefore a reservoir of functional genes that could be tapped to replace expression of a disease allele on the active X (Xa). A major gap in current understanding is the lack of a comprehensive Xist interactome. Progress toward a full interactome would advance knowledge of epigenetic regulation by long noncoding RNA and potentially inform treatment of X-linked diseases. RESULTS We have developed an RNA-centric proteomic method called iDRiP (identification of direct RNA-interacting proteins). Using iDRiP, we identified 80 to 200 proteins in the Xist interactome. The interactors fall into several functional categories, including cohesins, condensins, topoisomerases, RNA helicases, chromatin remodelers, histone modifiers, DNA methyltransferases, nucleoskeletal factors, and nuclear matrix proteins. Targeted inhibition demonstrates that Xi silencing can be destabilized by disrupting multiple components of the interactome, consistent with the idea that these factors synergistically repress Xi transcription. Triple-drug treatments lead to a net increase of Xi expression and up-regulation of \textasciitilde 100 to 200 Xi genes. We then carry out a focused study of X-linked cohesin sites. Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing analysis demonstrates three types of cohesin sites on the X chromosome: Xi-specific sites, Xa-specific sites, and biallelic sites. We find that the Xa-specific binding sites represent a default state. Ablating Xist results in restoration of Xa-specific sites on the Xi. These findings demonstrate that, while Xist attracts repressive complexes to the Xi, it actively repels chromosomal architectural factors such as the cohesins from the Xi. Finally, we examine how Xist and the repulsion of cohesins affect Xi chromosome structure. In wild-type cells, the Xa is characterized by \textasciitilde 112 topologically associated domains (TADs) and the Xi by two megadomains. Intriguingly, loss of Xist and restoration of cohesin binding result in a reversion of the Xi to an Xa-like chromosome conformation. Hi-C analysis shows that TADs return to the Xi in a manner correlated with the reappearance of cohesins and with a transcriptionally permissive state. CONCLUSION Our study unveils many layers of Xi repression and demonstrates a central role for RNA in the topological organization of mammalian chromosomes. Our study also supports a model in which Xist RNA simultaneously acts as (i) a scaffold for the recruitment of repressive complexes to establish and maintain the inactive state and (ii) a repulsion mechanism to extrude architectural factors such as cohesins to avoid acquisition of a transcription-favorable chromatin conformation. Finally, our findings indicate that the stability of the Xi can be perturbed by targeted inhibition of multiple components of the Xist interactome. View larger version: In this page In a new window Download PowerPoint Slide for Teaching An operational model for how Xist RNA orchestrates the Xi state.Xist is a multitasking RNA that brings many layers of repression to the Xi. Although Xist RNA recruits repressive complexes (such as PRC1, PRC2, DNMT1, macroH2A, and SmcHD1) to establish and maintain the inactive state, it also actively repels activating factors and architectural proteins (such as the cohesins and CTCF) to avoid acquisition of a transcription-favorable chromatin conformation. Protein partners for chromosome silencing Female mammals have two X chromosomes, one of which is almost completely shut down during development. The long noncoding Xist RNA plays a role in this process. To understand how a whole chromosome can be stably inactivated, Minajigi et al. identified many of the proteins that bind to the Xist RNA, which include cohesins. Paradoxically, the interaction between Xist and cohesin subunits resulted in repulsion of cohesin complexes from the inactive X chromosome, changing the three-dimensional shape of the whole chromosome.

Their usefulness is primarily linked to their ability to provide an indefinite source of biological material for experimental purposes. Under the right conditions and with appropriate controls, authenticated cancer cell lines retain most of the genetic properties of the cancer of origin. During the last few years, comparing genomic data of most cancer cell lines has corroborated this statement and those that were observed studying the tumoral tissue equivalents included in the The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. We are at the disposal of comprehensive open access cell line datasets describing their molecular and cellular alterations at an unprecedented level of accuracy. This aspect, in association with the possibility of setting up accurate culture conditions that mimic the in vivo microenvironment (e.g., three-dimensional (3D) coculture), has strengthened the importance of cancer cell lines for continuing to sustain medical research fields. However, it is important to consider that the appropriate use of cell lines needs to follow established guidelines for guaranteed data reproducibility and quality, and to prevent the occurrence of detrimental events (i.e., those that are linked to cross-contamination and mycoplasma contamination).},

However, the impact of a stem cell-like tumor phenotype (“stemness”) on the immunological properties of cancer has not been systematically explored. Using gene-expression–based metrics, we evaluated the association of stemness with immune cell infiltration and genomic, transcriptomic, and clinical parameters across 21 solid cancers. We found pervasive negative associations between cancer stemness and anticancer immunity. This occurred despite high stemness cancers exhibiting increased mutation load, cancer-testis antigen expression, and intratumoral heterogeneity. Stemness was also strongly associated with cell-intrinsic suppression of endogenous retroviruses and type I IFN signaling, and increased expression of multiple therapeutically accessible immunosuppressive pathways. Thus, stemness is not only a fundamental process in cancer progression but may provide a mechanistic link between antigenicity, intratumoral heterogeneity, and immune suppression across cancers.},

  abstract = {Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) is a non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of skin homing malignant CD4+ T cells. Early treatment of patients with skin-directed therapies often yields successful short-term outcomes; however, survival of patients with late-stage CTCL is extremely poor, highlighting the need to identify novel therapies to inhibit key oncogenic processes. Although the underlying factors driving CTCL pathogenesis are poorly understood, recent findings from our lab highlight the critical role of epigenetic dysregulation in its development (Mishra et al., Blood, 122:1826, 2013). While many studies have been carried out on the role of epigenetic writers (histone acetyltransferases) and erasers (histone deacetylases) in CTCL gene regulation, little is known about the epigenetic readers (bromodomains; tandem PHD fingers; Pleckstrin homology domains) that coordinate transcriptional reprogramming. Previous studies have identified bromodomain-containing protein-4 (BRD4) as a super-enhancer transcriptional regulator that interacts with pairs of acetylated lysine residues on histone H3 to upregulate oncogenic transcription in multiple myeloma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (Loven, J. et al. Cell 153, 2013; Chapuy, B. et al. Cancer Cell 24, 2013). We analyzed BRD4 occupancy patterns in the CTCL genome and characterized downstream oncogenic pathways. Additionally, we investigated the effect of treatment with a BRD4 inhibitor, JQ1, on CTCL in vitro and in vivo. In order to gain insights into the role of BRD4 in CTCL, we generated a genome-wide map of BRD4 occupancy in CD4+ T-cells from CTCL patients and normal donors using "ChIP-seq", which combines chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) with sequencing of BRD4-associated DNA. The analysis revealed an increased occupancy of BRD4 in patient's CD4+ T-cells compared to normal donor CD4+ T-cells at putative active regions, promoter active regions, distal active regions, and super-enhancers (Figure 1). The abnormal binding patterns in patients were reversed within 24 hours of treatment with JQ1 (Figure 1). Patient's cells treated with 1.0 μM JQ1 showed reduced cell viability (mean ± SEM of relative \% viability in JQ1 vs control treated cells: 39.67 ± 1.838 vs 100.0 ± 2.335, n=4 each). Furthermore, we saw a similar effect of JQ1 in all the patient-derived CTCL cell lines tested (HH, Hut78, Hut102, SeAx, and MyLa) with EC50 concentrations ranging from 0.167 to 21.0 μM. Since both primary CD4+ T-cells from CTCL patients and CTCL cell lines displayed sensitivity to the cytotoxic effect of JQ1, we performed subsequent functional assays on Hut78 cell line. Propidium iodide/Annexin staining of JQ1-treated Hut78 cells (1.0 μM for 48 hours) revealed an increased frequency of cells in the G1 phase, indicating significant disruption of cell cycle progression upon BRD4 inhibition. Furthermore, considering that a large portion of BRD4 binding was detected in promoter and super-enhancer regions, we speculated that BRD4 regulates tumor driver genes. When examining BRD4 occupancy, we found that BRD4 binding at NOTCH1, and MYC was higher in patients' vs normal donors' CD4+ T-cells. Similar differential increase in BRD4 occupancy was also noted at the DNA-binding factor gene RBPJ, a known NOTCH1 activator and T-cell oncogenic co-factor. In order to determine whether BRD4 occupancy at these genes exerts transcriptional regulation, we examined expression levels of RBPJ, NOTCH1, and MYC in JQ1 treated cells. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis on HuT78 cells treated with JQ1 showed significant reduction in RBPJ (mean ± SEM of relative expression in Control vs JQ1 treatment= 100.5 ± 07.086 vs. 35.39 ± 0.7832, n=3, P =0.0008), NOTCH1 (mean ± SEM of relative expression in Control vs JQ1 treatment= 100.0 ± 0.95 vs 0.61.77 ± 02.844, n=3, P =0.0002), and MYC (mean ± SEM of relative expression in Control vs JQ1 treatment= 100.1 ± 03.019 vs. 57.97 ± 01.997, n=3, P =0.0003). Additionally, in vivo treatment of CTCL mice with JQ1 (50mg/kg, 5 days/week for 4-weeks) halted as well as regressed progression of CTCL compared to placebo treated controls. Together, these findings demonstrate that BRD4 regulates the expression of the oncogenic drivers in CTCL, and that bromodomain inhibitors offer the opportunity to interrogate the mechanisms of BRD4-mediated T-cell oncogenesis in the CTCL mouse model and design new anti-cancer therapies in CTCL patients. {$<$}img class="highwire-fragment fragment-image" alt="Figure1" src="http://www.bloodjournal.org/content/bloodjournal/126/23/589/F1.medium.gif" width="440" height="190"/{$>$}Download figureOpen in new tabDownload powerpoint Disclosures Porcu: Cell Medica: Research Funding; Celgene: Research Funding; Shape: Research Funding; Seattle Genetics: Research Funding; Infinity: Research Funding.},

  abstract = {Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) is the most common type of primary cutaneous lymphoma. Here, we report that patients with CTCL show increased IL15 in a clinical stage–dependent manner. Mechanistically, we show that ZEB1 is a transcriptional repressor of IL15 in T cells and that hypermethylation of the ZEB1 binding region within the IL15 promoter, as seen in patients with CTCL, prevents ZEB1 binding and causes increased transcription of IL15. Using a transgenic mouse model of IL15, we provide evidence that overexpression of IL15 induces a spontaneous CTCL that mimics the human neoplasm. Excessive autocrine production of IL15 in T cells inhibits an HDAC1-mediated negative autoregulatory loop, resulting in the upregulation of HDAC1 and HDAC6 and transcriptional induction of the onco-miR-21. Interruption of IL15 downstream signaling with isotype-specific HDAC inhibitors halts (HDAC1) or significantly delays (HDAC6) the progression of CTCL in vivo and provides preclinical evidence supporting a hierarchical model of oncogenic signaling in CTCL. Significance: To date, CTCL pathogenesis remains unknown, and there are no curative therapies. Our findings not only demonstrate a critical role for IL15-mediated inflammation in cutaneous T-cell lymphomagenesis, but also uncover a new oncogenic regulatory loop in CTCL involving IL15, HDAC1, HDAC6, and miR-21 that shows differential sensitivity to isotype-specific HDAC inhibitors.

Despite the importance of AMPK, its specific roles within the different intracellular spaces remain unresolved, largely due to the lack of real-time, organelle-specific AMPK activity probes. Here, we present a series of molecular tools that allows for the measurement of AMPK activity at the different subcellular localizations and that allows for the rapid induction of AMPK inhibition. We discovered that AMPKα1, not~AMPKα2, was the subunit that preferentially conferred spatial specificity to AMPK, and that inhibition of AMPK activity at the mitochondria was sufficient for triggering cytosolic ATP increase. These findings suggest that genetically encoded molecular probes represent a powerful approach for revealing the basic principles of the spatiotemporal nature of AMPK regulation.},

  abstract = {Highly purified, small, resting murine Ig-positive spleen cells could be induced to proliferate by concanavalin A (Con A) if the activation was supported by allogeneic helper factors (AHF). Con A or AHF alone was unable to induce cell proliferation as determined by incorporation of [methyl-3H] thymidine. However, if AHF produced by a mixed lymphocyte culture was present together with Con A, the B lymphocytes were strongly activated exhibiting a stimulation index of approximately 2000 as compared to Con A alone. The dose-response maximum was obtained after a 4-day culture using 25\% of a supernatant from a mixed lymphocyte culture as a source of AHF. The kinetics of the AHF-supported B-cell activation was also investigated. The activation could be completely inhibited by the addition of 100 mM methyl alpha-D-mannopyranoside at the initiation of the culture, but, if added 14-18 hr later, the cells have had the necessary induction period and a proliferation could be recorded. AHF had to be present at the initiation of the cultures, otherwise the response immediately diminished, whereas Con A could be added up to 6 hr after initiation without affecting the proliferative response.},

  abstract = {Brain tumors are the most common solid tumors of childhood, and the genetic drivers and optimal therapeutic strategies for many of the different subtypes remain unknown. Here we identify that bithalamic gliomas harbor frequent mutations in the EGFR oncogene, only rare histone H3 mutation (in contrast to their unilateral counterparts), and a distinct genome-wide DNA methylation profile compared to all other glioma subtypes studied to date. These EGFR mutations are either small in-frame insertions within exon 20 (intracellular tyrosine kinase domain) or missense mutations within exon 7 (extracellular ligand-binding domain) that occur in the absence of accompanying gene amplification. We find these EGFR mutations are oncogenic in primary astrocyte models and confer sensitivity to specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors dependent on location within the kinase domain or extracellular domain. We initiated treatment with targeted kinase inhibitors in four children whose tumors harbor EGFR mutations with encouraging results. This study identifies a promising genomically-tailored therapeutic strategy for bithalamic gliomas, a lethal and genetically distinct brain tumor of childhood.},

  abstract = {Summary The evolution of digits was an essential step in the success of tetrapods. Among the key players, Hoxd genes are coordinately regulated in developing digits, where they help organize growth and patterns. We identified the distal regulatory sites associated with these genes by probing the three-dimensional architecture of this regulatory unit in developing limbs. This approach, combined with in~vivo deletions of distinct regulatory regions, revealed that the active part of the gene cluster contacts several enhancer-like sequences. These elements are dispersed throughout the nearby gene desert, and each contributes either quantitatively or qualitatively to Hox gene transcription in presumptive digits. We propose that this genetic system, which we call a “regulatory archipelago,” provides an inherent flexibility that may partly underlie the diversity in number and morphology of digits across tetrapods, as well as their resilience to drastic variations.

However, an understanding of the molecular architecture that mediates locus contraction remains unclear. We have combined high-resolution chromosome conformation capture (3C) techniques with 3D DNA FISH to identify three conserved topological subdomains. Each of these topological folds encompasses a major VH gene family that become juxtaposed in pro-B cells via megabase-scale chromatin looping. The transcription factor Pax5 organizes the subdomain that spans the VHJ558 gene family. In its absence, the J558 VH genes fail to associate with the proximal VH genes, thereby providing a plausible explanation for reduced VHJ558 gene rearrangements in Pax5-deficient pro-B cells. We propose that Igh locus contraction is the cumulative effect of several independently controlled chromatin subdomains that provide the structural infrastructure to coordinate optimal antigen receptor assembly.},

By integrating copy number data with transcriptional profiles and performing pathway analysis in primary DLBCLs, we identified a comprehensive set of copy number alterations (CNAs) that decreased p53 activity and perturbed cell cycle regulation. Primary tumors either had multiple complementary alterations of p53 and cell cycle components or largely lacked these lesions. DLBCLs with p53 and cell cycle pathway CNAs had decreased abundance of p53 target transcripts and increased expression of E2F target genes and the Ki67 proliferation marker. CNAs of the CDKN2A-TP53-RB-E2F axis provide a structural basis for increased proliferation in DLBCL, predict outcome with current therapy, and suggest targeted treatment approaches.},

This phenomenon has been studied most extensively in patients with follicular lymphoma and subsequent transformation to a diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, with little literature on HT in nonfollicular lymphomas. Despite a considerable body of information on the pathologic and molecular events associated with HT, its pathogenesis has remained elusive and the molecular information available has not been translated into clinical advances. It remains unclear if there is already a predisposition to HT and whether this can be detected at the time of diagnosis. The rituximab era has been characterized by a significant improvement in the prognosis of patients with B-cell lymphomas, but HT remains one of the most important challenges in the management of patients with indolent lymphoma, the difficulties starting with the diagnosis and definition of HT and ending with the appropriate management and treatment of the event. Going forward, it is crucial to incorporate HT as a major end point in clinical trials and to include patients with HT as subject of such studies if we are to see meaningful progress in the future.},

  abstract = {The proliferation of genetically modified mouse models has exposed phenotypic variation between investigators and institutions that has been challenging to control. In many cases, the microbiota is the presumed cause of the variation. Current solutions to account for phenotypic variability include littermate and maternal controls or defined microbial consortia in gnotobiotic mice. In conventionally raised mice, the microbiome is transmitted from the dam. Here we show that microbially driven dichotomous faecal immunoglobulin-A (IgA) levels in wild-type mice within the same facility mimic the effects of chromosomal mutations. We observe in multiple facilities that vertically transmissible bacteria in IgA-low mice dominantly lower faecal IgA levels in IgA-high mice after co-housing or faecal transplantation. In response to injury, IgA-low mice show increased damage that is transferable by faecal transplantation and driven by faecal IgA differences. We find that bacteria from IgA-low mice degrade the secretory component of secretory IgA as well as IgA itself. These data indicate that phenotypic comparisons between mice must take into account the non-chromosomal hereditary variation between different breeders. We propose faecal IgA as one marker of microbial variability and conclude that co-housing and/or faecal transplantation enables analysis of progeny from different dams.},

Using somatic mutation catalogues from 560 breast cancer whole-genome sequences, here we show that each of 12 base substitution, 2 insertion/deletion (indel) and 6 rearrangement mutational signatures present in breast tissue, exhibit distinct relationships with genomic features relating to transcription, DNA replication and chromatin organization. This signature-based approach permits visualization of the genomic distribution of mutational processes associated with APOBEC enzymes, mismatch repair deficiency and homologous recombinational repair deficiency, as well as mutational processes of unknown aetiology. Furthermore, it highlights mechanistic insights including a putative replication-dependent mechanism of APOBEC-related mutagenesis.},

We have now addressed the question of whether the nontransmissibility of Abutilon mosaic virus from Israel (AbMV-Is) is related to a lack of association between GroEL and the virus coat protein (CP). Translocation analysis has shown that, whereas TYLCV-Is DNA is conspicuous in the digestive tract, hemolymph, and salivary glands of B. tabaci 8 h after acquisition feeding started, AbMV-Is DNA was detected only in the insect digestive tract, even after 96 h. To determine whether AbMV-Is particles were rapidly degraded in the hemolymph as a result of their inability to interact with GroEL, we have isolated a GroEL gene from B. tabaci and used a yeast two-hybrid assay to compare binding of the CP of TYLCV-Is and AbMV-Is to the insect GroEL. The yeast assay showed that the CPs of the two viruses are able to bind efficiently to GroEL. We therefore suggest that, although GroEL-CP interaction in the hemolymph is a necessary condition for circulative transmission, the nontransmissibility of AbMV-Is is not the result of lack of binding to GroEL in the B. tabaci hemolymph, but most likely results from an inability to cross the gut/hemolymph barrier.},

Rates of protein synthesis are controlled by a wide range of agents that induce cell death, and in many instances, the changes that occur to the translational machinery precede overt apoptosis and loss of cell viability. The two principal ways in which factors required for translational activity are modified prior to and during apoptosis involve (i) changes in protein phosphorylation and (ii) specific proteolytic cleavages. In this review, we summarise the principal targets for such regulation, with particular emphasis on polypeptide chain initiation factors eIF2 and eIF4G and the eIF4E-binding proteins. We indicate how the functions of these factors and of other proteins with which they interact may be altered as a result of activation of apoptosis and we discuss the potential significance of such changes for translational control and cell growth regulation.},

In this context, coregulators, including both coactivators and corepressors, are pivotal intermediates that bridge chromatin-modifying enzymes and transcription factors. NCoR1 (nuclear receptor corepressor) and SMRT (silencing mediator of retinoic acid and thyroid hormone receptor) are among the best-characterized corepressors from a molecular point of view. These coregulators have conserved orthologs in lower organisms, which underscores their functional importance. Here we summarize the results from recent in vivo studies that reveal the wide-ranging roles of NCoR1 and SMRT in developmental as well as homeostatic processes, including metabolism, inflammation, and circadian rhythms. We also discuss the potential implications of NCoR1 and SMRT regulation of pathways ranging from genomic stability and carcinogenesis to metabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes.},

  abstract = {Tandem repeat (TR) expansions have been implicated in dozens of genetic diseases, including Huntington’s Disease, Fragile X Syndrome, and hereditary ataxias. Furthermore, TRs have recently been implicated in a range of complex traits, including gene expression and cancer risk. While the human genome harbors hundreds of thousands of TRs, analysis of TR expansions has been mainly limited to known pathogenic loci. A major challenge is that expanded repeats are beyond the read length of most next-generation sequencing (NGS) datasets and are not profiled by existing genome-wide tools. We present GangSTR, a novel algorithm for genome-wide genotyping of both short and expanded TRs. GangSTR extracts information from paired-end reads into a unified model to estimate maximum likelihood TR lengths. We validate GangSTR on real and simulated data and show that GangSTR outperforms alternative methods in both accuracy and speed. We apply GangSTR to a deeply sequenced trio to profile the landscape of TR expansions in a healthy family and validate novel expansions using orthogonal technologies. Our analysis reveals that healthy individuals harbor dozens of long TR alleles not captured by current genome-wide methods. GangSTR will likely enable discovery of novel disease-associated variants not currently accessible from NGS.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION:Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is the most metastatic variant of breast cancer with the poorest survival in all types of breast cancer patients and presently therapeutic targets for IBC are very limited. Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) is frequently expressed in human IBC and its expression positively correlates with worse clinical outcome. However, the molecular basis for EZH2 promoting IBC has not been explored. Here, we investigated the functional role of EZH2 in IBC cells by examining the effects of its knockdown on the formation of tumor spheroids and invasion of these cells in vitro and in vivo in an orthotopic xenograft model.METHODS:SUM149 and a new IBC cell line-FC-IBC-02 derived from pleural effusion fluid of an IBC patient were used in this study. Specific knockdown of EZH2 was performed using short hairpin RNA (shRNA) specific to the human EZH2 gene. Cell growth and the formation of tumor spheroids were examined in vitro. The effects of EZH2 knockdown on IBC cell migration and invasion were examined by a Boyden chamber assay. For the in vivo tumor growth studies, IBC cells were orthotopically transplanted into the mammary fat pads of immunodeficient mice.RESULTS:The results showed that EZH2 is expressed at higher levels in human IBC cell lines compared with normal human mammary epithelial cells, and the knockdown of EZH2 expression significantly suppressed cell growth and tumor spheroid formation of human IBC cells in vitro. In addition, EZH2 knockdown inhibited the migration and invasion of IBC cells. Significantly, EZH2 knockdown suppressed the angiogenesis and tumor growth of IBC cells in vivo.CONCLUSIONS:Our results provide direct evidence that EZH2 is critical for the formation of tumor spheroids and invasion of human IBC cells and could be a potential target for developing novel therapeutic strategies for human IBC.},

The Curriculum Task Force of the International Society of Computational Biology (ISCB) Education Committee has sought to provide a framework for training needs and curricula in terms of a set of bioinformatics core competencies that cut across many user personas and training programs. The initial competencies developed based on surveys of employers and training programs have since been refined through a multiyear process of community engagement. This report describes the current status of the competencies and presents a series of use cases illustrating how they are being applied in diverse training contexts. These use cases are intended to demonstrate how others can make use of the competencies and engage in the process of their continuing refinement and application.

  abstract = {Mitochondrial metabolism provides precursors to build macromolecules in growing cancer cells. In normally functioning tumour cell mitochondria, oxidative metabolism of glucose- and glutamine-derived carbon produces citrate and acetyl-coenzyme A for lipid synthesis, which is required for tumorigenesis. Yet some tumours harbour mutations in the citric acid cycle (CAC) or electron transport chain (ETC) that disable normal oxidative mitochondrial function, and it is unknown how cells from such tumours generate precursors for macromolecular synthesis. Here we show that tumour cells with defective mitochondria use glutamine-dependent reductive carboxylation rather than oxidative metabolism as the major pathway of citrate formation. This pathway uses mitochondrial and cytosolic isoforms of NADP+/NADPH-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase, and subsequent metabolism of glutamine-derived citrate provides both the acetyl-coenzyme A for lipid synthesis and the four-carbon intermediates needed to produce the remaining CAC metabolites and related macromolecular precursors. This reductive, glutamine-dependent pathway is the dominant mode of metabolism in rapidly growing malignant cells containing mutations in complex I or complex III of the ETC, in patient-derived renal carcinoma cells with mutations in fumarate hydratase, and in cells with normal mitochondria subjected to acute pharmacological ETC inhibition. Our findings reveal the novel induction of a versatile glutamine-dependent pathway that reverses many of the reactions of the canonical CAC, supports tumour cell growth, and explains how cells generate pools of CAC intermediates in the face of impaired mitochondrial metabolism.},

To identify cooperating oncogenic lesions, we performed a genome-wide analysis of leukaemic cells from 242 paediatric ALL patients using high-resolution, single-nucleotide polymorphism arrays and genomic DNA sequencing. Our analyses revealed deletion, amplification, point mutation and structural rearrangement in genes encoding principal regulators of B lymphocyte development and differentiation in 40\% of B-progenitor ALL cases. The PAX5 gene was the most frequent target of somatic mutation, being altered in 31.7\% of cases. The identified PAX5 mutations resulted in reduced levels of PAX5 protein or the generation of hypomorphic alleles. Deletions were also detected in TCF3 (also known as E2A), EBF1, LEF1, IKZF1 (IKAROS) and IKZF3 (AIOLOS). These findings suggest that direct disruption of pathways controlling B-cell development and differentiation contributes to B-progenitor ALL pathogenesis. Moreover, these data demonstrate the power of high-resolution, genome-wide approaches to identify new molecular lesions in cancer.},

In support of this possibility, effector memory T cells express markedly lower levels of Toso than those of naive T cells, indicating that activation in vivo correlates with the downregulation of Toso. Moreover, in vitro activation of memory T cells through TCR dramatically downregulates Toso expression compared with that of naive CD4 T cells. However, overexpression of Toso in human NK cells and Jurkat T cells does not inhibit Fas-mediated apoptosis, and, in agreement with other recent reports, Toso clearly functions as an IgM receptor. Unlike CD16, Toso expression by NK cells does not convey cytotoxic potential, but its ligation does trigger intracellular signaling in NK cells. In summary, our data indicate that Toso is a functional IgM receptor that is capable of activating signaling molecules, is regulated by IL-2, and is not inherently an antiapoptotic molecule.},

  abstract = {We have identified a novel gene referred to asactivation-induced deaminase (AID) by subtraction of cDNAs derived from switch-induced and uninduced murine B lymphoma CH12F3-2 cells, more than 80\% of which switch exclusively to IgA upon stimulation. The amino acid sequence encoded by AID cDNA is homologous to that of apolipoprotein B (apoB) mRNA-editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptide 1 (APOBEC-1), a type of cytidine deaminase that constitutes a catalytic subunit for the apoB mRNA-editing complex. In vitro experiments using a glutathione S-transferase AID fusion protein revealed significant cytidine deaminase activity that is blocked by tetrahydrouridine and by zinc chelation. However, AID alone did neither demonstrate activity in C to U editing of apoB mRNA nor bind to AU-rich RNA targets. AID mRNA expression is induced in splenic B cells that were activated in vitro or by immunizations with sheep red blood cells. In situ hybridization of immunized spleen sections revealed the restricted expression of AID mRNA in developing germinal centers in which modulation of immunoglobulin gene information through somatic hypermutation and class switch recombination takes place. Taken together, these findings suggest that AID is a new member of the RNA-editing deaminase family and may play a role in genetic events in the germinal center B cell.},

In this study, the primary aim was to detect markers to develop a clinically applicable method for distinguishing proneural and mesenchymal glioblastoma. The secondary aims were to investigate the temporospatial dynamics of these markers and to explore the association between these markers and the expression of chromatin-modifying genes. One hundred thirty-three glioma samples (grade II: 14 samples, grade III: 18, grade IV: 101) were analyzed. We quantified the expression of 6 signature genes associated with proneural and mesenchymal glioblastoma by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. We assigned proneural (PN) and mesenchymal (MES) scores based on the average of the 6 markers and calculated a predominant metagene (P-M) score by subtracting the MES from the PN score. We used these scores to analyze correlations with malignant transformation, tumor recurrence, tumor heterogeneity, chromatin-modifying gene expression, and HDAC7 expression. The MES score positively correlated with tumor grade, whereas the PN score did not. The P-M score was able to distinguish the proneural and mesenchymal subtypes. It was decreased in cases of tumor recurrence and malignant transformation and showed variability within a tumor, suggesting intratumoral heterogeneity. The PN score correlated with the expression of multiple histone-modifying genes, whereas the MES score was associated only with HDAC7 expression. Thus, we demonstrated a simple and straightforward method of quantifying proneural/mesenchymal markers in glioblastoma. Of note, HDAC7 expression might be a novel therapeutic target in glioblastoma treatment.},

  abstract = {Abstract Transcription factors of the MYC family are deregulated in the majority of all human cancers. Oncogenic levels of MYC reprogram cellular metabolism, a hallmark of cancer development, to sustain the high rate of proliferation of cancer cells. Conversely, cells need to modulate MYC function according to the availability of nutrients, in order to avoid a metabolic collapse. Here, we review recent evidence that the multiple interactions of MYC with cell metabolism are mutual and review mechanisms that control MYC levels and function in response to metabolic stress situations. The main hypothesis we put forward is that regulation of MYC levels is an integral part of the adaptation of cells to nutrient deprivation. Since such mechanisms would be particularly relevant in tumor cells, we propose that?in contrast to growth factor-dependent controls?they are not disrupted during tumorigenesis and that maintaining flexibility of expression is integral to MYC's oncogenic function.},

Air is required for allele-specific silencing of the cis-linked Slc22a3, Slc22a2, and Igf2r genes in mouse placenta. We show that Air interacts with the Slc22a3 promoter chromatin and the H3K9 histone methyltransferase G9a in placenta. Air accumulates at the Slc22a3 promoter in correlation with localized H3K9 methylation and transcriptional repression. Genetic ablation of G9a results in nonimprinted, biallelic transcription of Slc22a3. Truncated Air fails to accumulate at the Slc22a3 promoter, which results in reduced G9a recruitment and biallelic transcription. Our results suggest that Air, and potentially other large ncRNAs, target repressive histone-modifying activities through molecular interaction with specific chromatin domains to epigenetically silence transcription. Air, a large noncoding RNA, interacts with chromatin at a particular promoter, recruiting a histone methyltransferase to silence gene expression in an allele-specific manner.

Despite this structural stochasticity, localization of active gene domains to boundaries of chromosome territories is a hallmark of chromosomal conformation. Single-cell Hi-C data bridge current gaps between genomics and microscopy studies of chromosomes, demonstrating how modular organization underlies dynamic chromosome structure, and how this structure is probabilistically linked with genome activity patterns.},

  abstract = {To understand better T-cell lymphomagenesis, we examined promoter CpG methylation and mRNA expression of closely related genes encoding p16, p15, and p14 tumor suppressor genes in cultured malignant T-cells that were derived from cutaneous, adult type, and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-expressing T-cell lymphomas. p16 gene was epigenetically silenced in all but one of the 10 malignant T-cell lines examined, p15 gene silenced in roughly half of the lines, and p14 was the least frequently affected. Extensive methylation of the p16 promoter was seen in six out of 10 cutaneous T-cell lymphoma patient samples and corresponded with lack of p16 protein expression in the cases examined. Treatment of cultured T-cells with the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, 5-aza-2-deoxy-cytidine, resulted in reversal of the p16 gene silencing. However, expression of p16 protein was delayed in relationship to p16 promoter demethylation and required up to 3 weeks to occur, seemingly reflecting late activation of the p16 gene. These findings indicate that epigenetic silencing affects in T-cell malignancies, often simultaneously, several tumor suppressor genes that impact on key cell functions. The observed differential silencing of p16 and p14, and to a lesser degree p15 gene, indicates that the silencing is governed by precise, promoter region-specific mechanisms. The study provides also further rationale for treatment of at least some types of T-cell lymphomas with DNA methyltransferase inhibitors to target the epigenetically silenced tumor suppressor genes.},

In this pilot study, biomedical doctoral students (N = 69; 12\% of enrolled biomedical doctoral students at a large research institution’s school of medicine in the United States) were administered standardized psychiatric interviews and self-report questionnaires focused on dimensions of burnout, mental health symptoms, and academic outcomes. We discovered high levels of burnout, depression, and anxiety. Additionally, we identified that burnout was significantly associated with thoughts related to dropping out, subjective appraisal of employment opportunities, functional impairment due to a mental health problem, and having at least one current psychiatric disorder. These findings extend prior research indicating the presence of significant emotional health challenges doctoral students in biomedical graduate programs face involving high burnout and difficulties with the training environment. We outline several recommendations and next steps to programmatically understand and address these emerging emotional wellness concerns in biomedical doctoral students.},

  abstract = {Many metabolic and physiological processes display circadian oscillations. We have shown that the core circadian regulator, CLOCK, is a histone acetyltransferase whose activity is counterbalanced by the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+)–dependent histone deacetylase SIRT1. Here we show that intracellular NAD+ levels cycle with a 24-hour rhythm, an oscillation driven by the circadian clock. CLOCK:BMAL1 regulates the circadian expression of NAMPT (nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase), an enzyme that provides a rate-limiting step in the NAD+ salvage pathway. SIRT1 is recruited to the Nampt promoter and contributes to the circadian synthesis of its own coenzyme. Using the specific inhibitor FK866, we demonstrated that NAMPT is required to modulate circadian gene expression. Our findings in mouse embryo fibroblasts reveal an interlocked transcriptional-enzymatic feedback loop that governs the molecular interplay between cellular metabolism and circadian rhythms. A transcriptional-enzymatic feedback loop controls interactions between metabolism and circadian rhythms in mouse cells. A transcriptional-enzymatic feedback loop controls interactions between metabolism and circadian rhythms in mouse cells.},

Previous studies have implicated hypomethylated regions in gene regulation, but their functions in vertebrate development remain elusive.

These key genes were found to be under strong transcriptional repression, when compared with other developmental genes with smaller K27HMDs. Furthermore, human-specific K27HMDs show an enrichment of neuronal activity-related genes, which suggests a distinct regulation of these genes in medaka and human. In mature organs, some of the large HMDs become shortened by elevated DNA methylation and associate with sustained gene expression.

We provide in vivo evidence that lysine 9 of histone H3 (H3 Lys9) is preferentially methylated by the Clr4 protein at heterochromatin-associated regions in fission yeast. Both the conserved chromo- and SET domains of Clr4 are required for H3 Lys9 methylation in vivo. Localization of Swi6, a homolog of Drosophila HP1, to heterochomatic regions is dependent on H3 Lys9 methylation. Moreover, an H3-specific deacetylase Clr3 and a beta-propeller domain protein Rik1 are required for H3 Lys9 methylation by Clr4 and Swi6 localization. These data define a conserved pathway wherein sequential histone modifications establish a "histone code" essential for the epigenetic inheritance of heterochromatin assembly.},

  abstract = {Homeostasis of both NK and T cells in the periphery is regulated by activation induced cell death (AICD) mediated by signaling through Fas, and other death receptors. It has been shown that IL-2 is required for priming cells for this type of apoptosis. Cytokine primed NK cells, in addition to killing their target cells, also undergo AICD upon activation by activating ligands expressed by the target cells. TOSO is an anti-apoptotic molecule known to inhibit apoptosis mediated by the death receptor pathway and we investigated the role of TOSO in regulating AICD in NK and T cells. We observed by realtime PCR that stimulation of human NK cells and T cells in vitro with IL-2 resulted in down regulation of TOSO. We further analyzed TOSO expression levels on sorted human CD4 T cells and found that cells with an effector/memory phenotype have markedly lower levels of TOSO than naïve cells, which suggests that activation in vivo correlates with down-regulation of TOSO. In agreement, we found that activation of CD45RO+ cells in vitro dramatically down regulated TOSO compared to naïve CD4 T cells. Further, overexpression of Toso in Jurkat cells was able to inhibit Fas-mediated cell death. We hypothesize that IL-2 has a dual action: first, it activates and induces the proliferation of NK and T-cells and second, it down-regulates TOSO, thereby sensitizing or priming them for apoptosis upon re-stimulation. Considering that IL-2 is being used as a therapeutic agent for cancer treatment and the recent study showing that HIV envelope protein can down regulate TOSO levels on CD4 T cells, unraveling how TOSO functions and is regulated might have potential for treating cancer and other diseases.},

The method has become widely adopted and has been modified to increase throughput to allow unbiased genome-wide analysis. These large-scale adaptations are presented in other articles in this issue of Methods. Here we describe the 3C procedure in detail, including the appropriate use of the technology, the experimental set-up, an optimized protocol and troubleshooting guide, and considerations for data analysis. The protocol described here contains previously unpublished improvements, which save time and reduce labor. We pay special attention to primer design, appropriate controls and data analysis. We include notes and discussion based on our extensive experience to help researchers understand the principles of 3C-based techniques and to avoid common pitfalls and mistakes.

We have examined the methylation-induced silencing of tumor suppressor microRNAs in HL cell lines and confirmed our results in patient lymph nodes. In addition, we evaluated the in vitro effectiveness of 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine (5-Aza-dC) in HL cell lines. Ten microRNAs containing CpG islands in their promoter region were re-expressed in both the L-428 and L-1236 cell lines. Interestingly, miR-34a and miR-203, both known tumor suppressor microRNAs, were found to be methylated in cell lines and in patient samples. 5-Aza-dC treatment resulted in a dose-dependent antiproliferative effect at 72 h in all the HL cell lines. In summary, 5-Aza-dC treatment of HL cell lines inhibits proliferation at high doses and produces re-expression of the tumor suppressor microRNAs at low-intermediate doses.},

  abstract = {Another micropeptide flexes its muscle Genome annotation is a complex but imperfect art. Attesting to its limitations is the growing evidence that certain transcripts annotated as long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in fact code for small peptides with biologically important functions. One such lncRNA-derived micropeptide in mammals is myoregulin, which reduces muscle performance by inhibiting the activity of a key calcium pump. Nelson et al. describe the opposite activity in a second lncRNA-derived micropeptide in mammalian muscle, called DWORF (see the Perspective by Payre and Desplan). This peptide enhances muscle performance by activating the same calcium pump. DWORF may prove to be useful in improving the cardiac muscle function of mammals with heart disease. Science, this issue p. 271; see also p. 226 Muscle contraction depends on release of Ca2+ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) and reuptake by the Ca2+adenosine triphosphatase SERCA. We discovered a putative muscle-specific long noncoding RNA that encodes a peptide of 34 amino acids and that we named dwarf open reading frame (DWORF). DWORF localizes to the SR membrane, where it enhances SERCA activity by displacing the SERCA inhibitors, phospholamban, sarcolipin, and myoregulin. In mice, overexpression of DWORF in cardiomyocytes increases peak Ca2+ transient amplitude and SR Ca2+ load while reducing the time constant of cytosolic Ca2+ decay during each cycle of contraction-relaxation. Conversely, slow skeletal muscle lacking DWORF exhibits delayed Ca2+ clearance and relaxation and reduced SERCA activity. DWORF is the only endogenous peptide known to activate the SERCA pump by physical interaction and provides a means for enhancing muscle contractility. A long noncoding RNA encodes a small peptide that activates a calcium pump regulating muscle contraction. [Also see Perspective by Payre and Desplan] A long noncoding RNA encodes a small peptide that activates a calcium pump regulating muscle contraction. [Also see Perspective by Payre and Desplan]},

  abstract = {Abnormal epigenetic control is a common early event in tumour progression, and aberrant acetylation in particular has been implicated in tumourigenesis. One of the most promising approaches towards drugs that modulate epigenetic processes has been seen in the development of inhibitors of histone deacetylases (HDACs). HDACs regulate the acetylation of histones in nucleosomes, which mediates changes in chromatin conformation, leading to regulation of gene expression. HDACs also regulate the acetylation status of a variety of other non-histone substrates, including key tumour suppressor proteins and oncogenes. Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDIs) are potent anti-proliferative agents which modulate acetylation by targeting histone deacetylases. Interest is increasing in HDI-based therapies and so far, two HDIs, vorinostat (SAHA) and romidepsin (FK228), have been approved for treating cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL). Others are undergoing clinical trials. Treatment with HDIs prompts tumour cells to undergo apoptosis, and cell-based studies have shown a number of other outcomes to result from HDI treatment, including cell-cycle arrest, cell differentiation, anti-angiogenesis and autophagy. However, our understanding of the key pathways through which HDAC inhibitors affect tumour cell growth remains incomplete, which has hampered progress in identifying malignancies other than CTCL which are likely to respond to HDI treatment.},

Natural IgM is an evolutionarily conserved molecule and reacts with a variety of epitopes expressed on both self- and non-self antigens. It has long been understood that secreted (s) IgM contributes to the removal of altered self-antigens, such as apoptotic and dying cells. As we outline in this review, it is thought that this sIgM housekeeping function removes potential triggers of autoresponse induction. However, we recently demonstrated an unexpected and distinct role for sIgM in the control of autoreactive B cells: the regulation of bone marrow B cell development. The absence of sIgM blocked pro- to pre- B-cell transition and greatly altered the BCR repertoire of the developing B cells and the peripheral B-cell pools in genetically engineered mice. This finding strongly suggests that IgM is critical for B-cell central tolerance induction.

  abstract = {c-MYC is one of the most essential transcriptional factors, regulating a diverse array of cellular functions, including proliferation, growth, and apoptosis. Dysregulation of c-MYC is essential in the pathogenesis of a number of B-cell lymphomas, but is rarely reported in T-cell lymphomas. c-MYC dysregulation induces lymphomagenesis by loss of the tight control of c-MYC expression, leading to overexpression of intact c-MYC protein, in contrast to the somatic mutations or fusion proteins seen in many other oncogenes. Dysregulation of c-MYC in B-cell lymphomas occurs either as a primary event in Burkitt lymphoma, or secondarily in aggressive lymphomas such as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, plasmablastic lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma, or double-hit lymphoma. Secondary c-MYC changes include gene translocation and gene amplification, occurring against a background of complex karyotype, and most often confer aggressive clinical behavior, as evidenced in the double-hit lymphomas. In low-grade B-cell lymphomas, acquisition of c-MYC rearrangement usually results in transformation into highly aggressive lymphomas, with some exceptions. In this review, we discuss the role that c-MYC plays in the pathogenesis of B-cell lymphomas, the molecular alterations that lead to c-MYC dysregulation, and their effect on prognosis and diagnosis in specific types of B-cell lymphoma.},

Exposure of DLBCL cells to very low concentrations of volasertib in combination with belinostat synergistically increased cell death (apoptosis). Similar interactions occurred in GC-, ABC-, double-hit DLBCL cells, MCL cells, bortezomib-resistant cells and primary lymphoma cells. Co-exposure to volasertib/belinostat induced a marked increase in M-phase arrest, phospho-histone H3, mitotic errors, cell death in M-phase, and DNA damage. Belinostat diminished c-Myc mRNA and protein expression, an effect significantly enhanced by volasertib co-exposure. c-Myc knock-down increased DNA damage and cell death in response to volasertib, arguing that c-Myc down-regulation plays a functional role in the lethality of this regimen. Notably, PLK1 knock-down in DLBCL cells significantly increased belinostat-induced M-phase accumulation, phospho-histone H3, γH2AX, and cell death. Co-administration of volasertib and belinostat dramatically reduced tumor growth in an ABC-DLBCL flank model (U2932) and a systemic double-hit lymphoma model (OCI-Ly18), accompanied by a pronounced increase in survival without significant weight loss or other toxicities. Together, these findings indicate that PLK1/HDAC inhibition warrants attention as a therapeutic strategy in NHL.},

  abstract = {The regulation of cellular survival and apoptosis is of critical importance for the immune system to maintain immune homeostasis and to establish tolerance. Here, we demonstrate that the immune specific cell surface molecule Toso exhibits antiapoptotic effects on death receptor signaling by a novel regulatory mechanism involving the adaptor kinase RIP1. The antiapoptotic function of Toso depends on RIP1 ubiquitination and involves the recruitment of the death adaptor FADD to a Toso/RIP1 protein complex. In response to CD95L and TNFα, Toso promotes the activation of MAPK and NF-κB signaling pathways. Because of this relative augmentation of survival versus apoptotic signals, Toso raises the threshold for death receptor–mediated apoptosis. Our analysis of Toso-deficient mice revealed that Toso is essential for TNFα-mediated liver damage. Furthermore, the antiapoptotic function of Toso could be blocked by a Toso-specific monoclonal antibody, opening up new therapeutic prospects for the treatment of immune disorders and hematologic malignancies.},

Inactivating mutations of PRDM1 have been previously identified in a subset of nongerminal center B cell-like (GCB) DLBCL. We investigated the presence of alternative mechanisms of down-regulating PRDM1 in a cohort of 25 primary DLBCL and six DLBCL cell lines. While some DLBCL, predominantly the GCB-type, showed low levels of both PRDM1alpha mRNA and protein, presumably as a result of direct transcription repression, discordant expressions between the two were identified in a subset of DLBCL without PRDM1 mutations, the primarily non-GCB type, consistent with translational down-regulation. This subset of DLBCL exhibits relatively high PRDM1alpha mRNA levels but low levels of PRDM1. Data obtained from expression analysis, luciferase reporter assays, and transfection experiments support a role of targeting of PRDM1 by microRNA let-7 family in mediating this down-regulation. Let-7, in particular let-7b, is overexpressed in DLBCL relative to normal GCB cells, suggesting that it is deregulated. Thus, abnormal epigenetic down-regulation of PRDM1 by let-7 and other microRNAs may represent an alternative mechanism of reducing normal PRDM1 function in a subset of DLBCL with relatively high PRDM1alpha mRNA expression and unmutated PRDM1. These findings provide further evidence for an important role of impairment of terminal B cell differentiation in DLBCL pathogenesis.},

They divide and generate myelinating oligodendrocytes (OLs) throughout postnatal and adult life. OPCs express NG2 and platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha subunit (PDGFRα), two functionally important cell surface proteins, which are also widely used as markers for OPCs. The proliferation of OPCs, their terminal differentiation into OLs, survival of new OLs, and myelin synthesis are orchestrated by signals in the local microenvironment. We discuss advances in our mechanistic understanding of paracrine effects, including those mediated through PDGFRα and neuronal activity-dependent signals such as those mediated through AMPA receptors in OL survival and myelination. Finally, we review recent studies supporting the role of new OL production and “adaptive myelination” in specific behaviours and cognitive processes contributing to learning and long-term memory formation.

  abstract = {In eukaryotes transcriptional regulation often involves multiple long-range elements and is influenced by the genomic environment. A prime example of this concerns the mouse X-inactivation centre (Xic), which orchestrates the initiation of X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) by controlling the expression of the non-protein-coding Xist transcript. The extent of Xic sequences required for the proper regulation of Xist remains unknown. Here we use chromosome conformation capture carbon-copy (5C) and super-resolution microscopy to analyse the spatial organization of a 4.5-megabases (Mb) region including Xist. We discover a series of discrete 200-kilobase to 1 Mb topologically associating domains (TADs), present both before and after cell differentiation and on the active and inactive X. TADs align with, but do not rely on, several domain-wide features of the epigenome, such as H3K27me3 or H3K9me2 blocks and lamina-associated domains. TADs also align with coordinately regulated gene clusters. Disruption of a TAD boundary causes ectopic chromosomal contacts and long-range transcriptional misregulation. The Xist/Tsix sense/antisense unit illustrates how TADs enable the spatial segregation of oppositely regulated chromosomal neighbourhoods, with the respective promoters of Xist and Tsix lying in adjacent TADs, each containing their known positive regulators. We identify a novel distal regulatory region of Tsix within its TAD, which produces a long intervening RNA, Linx. In addition to uncovering a new principle of cis-regulatory architecture of mammalian chromosomes, our study sets the stage for the full genetic dissection of the X-inactivation centre.},

The primary aim of our study was to improve risk stratification of ALL patients into treatment groups using DNA methylation as a complement to current diagnostic methods. A secondary aim was to gain insight into the functional role of DNA methylation in ALL. RESULTS: We used the methylation status of \textasciitilde 450,000 CpG sites in 546 well-characterized patients with T-ALL or seven recurrent B-cell precursor ALL subtypes to design and validate sensitive and accurate DNA methylation classifiers. After repeated cross-validation, a final classifier was derived that consisted of only 246 CpG sites. The mean sensitivity and specificity of the classifier across the known subtypes was 0.90 and 0.99, respectively. We then used DNA methylation classification to screen for subtype membership of 210 patients with undefined karyotype (normal or no result) or non-recurrent cytogenetic aberrations ('other' subtype). Nearly half (n\,=\,106) of the patients lacking cytogenetic subgrouping displayed highly similar methylation profiles as the patients in the known recurrent groups. We verified the subtype of 20\% of the newly classified patients by examination of diagnostic karyotypes, array-based copy number analysis, and detection of fusion genes by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq). Using RNA-seq data from ALL patients where cytogenetic subtype and DNA methylation classification did not agree, we discovered several novel fusion genes involving ETV6, RUNX1, and PAX5. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that DNA methylation profiling contributes to the clarification of the heterogeneity in cytogenetically undefined ALL patient groups and could be implemented as a complementary method for diagnosis of ALL. The results of our study provide clues to the origin and development of leukemic transformation. The methylation status of the CpG sites constituting the classifiers also highlight relevant biological characteristics in otherwise unclassified ALL patients.},

The relationship between DNA methylation, cytogenetic background, drug resistance and relapse in ALL is poorly understood. Results We surveyed the DNA methylation levels of 435,941 CpG sites in samples from 764 children at diagnosis of ALL and from 27 children at relapse. This survey uncovered four characteristic methylation signatures. First, compared with control blood cells, the methylomes of ALL cells shared 9,406 predominantly hypermethylated CpG sites, independent of cytogenetic background. Second, each cytogenetic subtype of ALL displayed a unique set of hyper- and hypomethylated CpG sites. The CpG sites that constituted these two signatures differed in their functional genomic enrichment to regions with marks of active or repressed chromatin. Third, we identified subtype-specific differential methylation in promoter and enhancer regions that were strongly correlated with gene expression. Fourth, a set of 6,612 CpG sites was predominantly hypermethylated in ALL cells at relapse, compared with matched samples at diagnosis. Analysis of relapse-free survival identified CpG sites with subtype-specific differential methylation that divided the patients into different risk groups, depending on their methylation status. Conclusions Our results suggest an important biological role for DNA methylation in the differences between ALL subtypes and in their clinical outcome after treatment.},

  abstract = {Medulloblastoma is a highly malignant paediatric brain tumour currently treated with a combination of surgery, radiation and chemotherapy, posing a considerable burden of toxicity to the developing child. Genomics has illuminated the extensive intertumoral heterogeneity of medulloblastoma, identifying four distinct molecular subgroups. Group 3 and group 4 subgroup medulloblastomas account for most paediatric cases; yet, oncogenic drivers for these subtypes remain largely unidentified. Here we describe a series of prevalent, highly disparate genomic structural variants, restricted to groups 3 and 4, resulting in specific and mutually exclusive activation of the growth factor independent 1 family proto-oncogenes, GFI1 and GFI1B. Somatic structural variants juxtapose GFI1 or GFI1B coding sequences proximal to active enhancer elements, including super-enhancers, instigating oncogenic activity. Our results, supported by evidence from mouse models, identify GFI1 and GFI1B as prominent medulloblastoma oncogenes and implicate ‘enhancer hijacking’ as an efficient mechanism driving oncogene activation in a childhood cancer.},

We identified modules of highly co-expressed genes, some of which are restricted to a single lineage, but most are expressed at variable levels across multiple lineages. We found densely interconnected cis-regulatory circuits and a large number of transcription factors that are differentially expressed across hematopoietic states.

  abstract = {Meiotic and early-embryonic cell divisions in vertebrates take place in the absence of transcription and rely on the translational regulation of stored maternal messenger RNAs. Most of these mRNAs are regulated by the cytoplasmic-polyadenylation-element-binding protein (CPEB), which mediates translational activation and repression through cytoplasmic changes in their poly(A) tail length. It was unknown whether translational regulation by cytoplasmic polyadenylation and CPEB can also regulate mRNAs at specific points of mitotic cell-cycle divisions. Here we show that CPEB-mediated post-transcriptional regulation by phase-specific changes in poly(A) tail length is required for cell proliferation and specifically for entry into M phase in mitotically dividing cells. This translational control is mediated by two members of the CPEB family of proteins, CPEB1 and CPEB4. We conclude that regulation of poly(A) tail length is not only required to compensate for the lack of transcription in specialized cell divisions but also acts as a general mechanism to control mitosis.},

Development of T follicular helper (TFH) cells that provide help to B cells is mediated by the cytokines interleukin-6 and interleukin-21 but is independent of TH1, TH2, and TH17 effector cell lineages. Here, we characterize the function of Bcl6, a transcription factor selectively expressed in TFH cells. Bcl6 expression is regulated by interleukin-6 and interleukin-21. Bcl6 overexpression induced TFH-related gene expression and inhibited other TH lineage cell differentiation in a DNA binding–dependent manner. Moreover, Bcl6 deficiency in T cells resulted in impaired TFH cell development and germinal center reactions, and altered production of other effector T cell subsets. Our data thus illustrate that Bcl6 is required for programming of TFH cell generation. The transcription factors that regulate follicular T helper cell differentiation are identified.

  abstract = {Charting differences between tumors and normal tissue is a mainstay of cancer research. However, clonal tumor expansion from complex normal tissue architectures potentially obscures cancer-specific events, including divergent epigenetic patterns. Using whole-genome bisulfite sequencing of normal B cell subsets, we observed broad epigenetic programming of selective transcription factor binding sites coincident with the degree of B cell maturation. By comparing normal B cells to malignant B cells from 268 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), we showed that tumors derive largely from a continuum of maturation states reflected in normal developmental stages. Epigenetic maturation in CLL was associated with an indolent gene expression pattern and increasingly favorable clinical outcomes. We further uncovered that most previously reported tumor-specific methylation events are normally present in non-malignant B cells. Instead, we identified a potential pathogenic role for transcription factor dysregulation in CLL, where excess programming by EGR and NFAT with reduced EBF and AP-1 programming imbalances the normal B cell epigenetic program.},

  abstract = {Although clonal selection by genetic driver aberrations in cancer is well documented, the ability of epigenetic alterations to promote tumor evolution is undefined. We used 450k arrays and next-generation sequencing to evaluate intratumor heterogeneity and evolution of DNA methylation and genetic aberrations in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). CLL cases exhibit vast interpatient differences in intratumor methylation heterogeneity, with genetically clonal cases maintaining low methylation heterogeneity and up to 10\% of total CpGs in a monoallelically methylated state. Increasing methylation heterogeneity correlates with advanced genetic subclonal complexity. Selection of novel DNA methylation patterns is observed only in cases that undergo genetic evolution, and independent genetic evolution is uncommon and is restricted to low-risk alterations. These results reveal that although evolution of DNA methylation occurs in high-risk, clinically progressive cases, positive selection of novel methylation patterns entails coevolution of genetic alteration(s) in CLL. Significance: Epigenetic alterations are pervasive in cancer and continually develop during disease progression; however, the mechanisms that promote changes in the tumor epigenome at large are currently undefined. The current work provides insight into the coevolution of genetic and epigenetic aberrations and highlights the influential role of genetic aberrations in the selection of novel methylation patterns.

  abstract = {Understanding how tumor cells fundamentally alter their identity is critical to identify specific vulnerabilities for use in precision medicine. In B cell malignancy, knowledge of genetic changes has resulted in great gains in our understanding of the biology of tumor cells, impacting diagnosis, prognosis and treatment. Despite this knowledge, much remains to be explained as genetic events do not completely explain clinical behavior and outcomes. Many patients lack recurrent driver mutations, and said drivers can persist in non-malignant cells of healthy individuals remaining cancer-free for decades. Epigenetics has emerged as a valuable avenue to further explain tumor phenotypes. The epigenetic landscape is the software that powers and stabilizes cellular identity by abridging a broad genome into the essential information required per cell. A genome-level view of B cell malignancies reveals complex but recurrent epigenetic patterns that define tumor types and subtypes, permitting high-resolution classification and novel insight into tumor-specific mechanisms. Epigenetic alterations are guided by distinct cellular processes, such as polycomb-based silencing, transcription, signaling pathways and transcription factor (TF) activity, and involve B cell-specific aspects, such as AIDCA activity and germinal center-specific events. Armed with a detailed knowledge of the epigenetic events that occur across the spectrum of B cell differentiation, B cell tumor-specific aberrations can be detected with improved accuracy, and serves as a model for identification of tumor-specific events in cancer. Insight gained through recent efforts may prove valuable in guiding the use of both epigenetic- and non-epigenetic-based therapies.},

To identify genetic variations that might confer susceptibility to IgAN, we performed a case-control association study involving 389 Japanese IgAN patients and 465 controls. Genome-wide analysis of approximately 80,000 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) identified a significant association between IgAN and six SNPs located in the PIGR (polymeric immuoglobulin receptor) gene at chromosome 1q31-q41. One of them, PIGR-17, caused an amino-acid substitution from alanine to valine at codon 580 (χ2=13.05, P=0.0003, odds ratio [OR] =1.59, 95\% confidence interval [95\% CI] =1.24–2.05); the OR of minor homozygotes to others was 2.71 (95\% CI=1.31–5.61). Another SNP, PIGR-2, could affect promoter activity (χ2=11.95, P=0.00055, OR=1.60, 95\% CI=1.22–2.08); the OR of minor homozygotes to others was 2.08 (95\% CI=0.94–4.60). Pairwise analyses demonstrated that all six SNPs were in almost complete linkage disequilibrium. Biopsy specimens from IgAN patients were positively stained by antibody against the secretory component of PIGR, but corresponding tissues from non-IgAN patients were not. Our results suggest that a gene associated with susceptibility to IgAN lies within or close to the PIGR gene locus on chromosome 1q in the Japanese population.},

These oncogenic mutations in histones, now termed “oncohistones”, were discovered through genome-wide sequencing of pediatric diffuse high-grade glioma. Up to 80\% of diffuse midline glioma (DMG), including diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) and diffuse glioma arising in other midline structures including thalamus or spinal cord, contain histone H3 lysine 27 to methionine (K27M) mutations or, rarely, other alterations that result in a depletion of H3K27me3 similar to that induced by H3 K27M. This subgroup of glioma is now defined as diffuse midline glioma, H3K27-altered. In contrast, histone H3 Gly34Arg/Val (G34R/V) mutations are found in approximately 30\% of diffuse glioma arising in the cerebral hemispheres of older adolescents and young adults, now classified as diffuse hemispheric glioma, H3G34-mutant. Here, we review how oncohistones modulate the epigenome and discuss the mutational landscape and invasive properties of histone mutant HGGs of childhood. The distinct mechanisms through which oncohistones and other mutations rewrite the epigenetic landscape provide novel insights into development and tumorigenesis and may present unique vulnerabilities for pHGGs. Lessons learned from these rare incurable brain tumors of childhood may have broader implications for cancer, as additional high- and low-frequency oncohistone mutations have been identified in other tumor types.},

Its differing concentrations appear to regulate mutually antagonistic programs of B and plasma cell gene expression. We show IRF4 to be also required for generation of germinal center (GC) B cells. Its transient expression in~vivo induced the expression of key GC genes including Bcl6 and Aicda. In contrast, sustained and higher concentrations of IRF4 promoted the generation of plasma cells while antagonizing the GC fate. IRF4 cobound with the transcription factors PU.1 or BATF to Ets or AP-1 composite motifs, associated with genes involved in B cell activation and the GC response. At higher concentrations, IRF4 binding shifted to interferon sequence response motifs; these enriched for genes involved in plasma cell differentiation. Our results support a model of “kinetic control” in which signaling-induced dynamics of IRF4 in activated B cells control their cell-fate outcomes.},

In contrast, little is known concerning the chromatin modifications associated with somatic hypermutation (SHM) in vivo. Here, we report that several modifications--including histone acetylation and H3-lysine 4 methylation--fail to demarcate an actively hypermutating immunoglobulin (Ig) locus or to correlate spatially with SHM within Ig loci. Furthermore, no obvious association between SHM and gammaH2AX could be detected. Instead, we find that the phosphorylated form of histone H2B (H2B(Ser14P)) correlates tightly with SHM and CSR. Phosphorylation of H2B within Ig variable and switch regions requires AID and may be mediated by the histone kinase Mst1. These findings indicate that SHM and CSR trigger distinct DNA damage responses and identify a novel histone modification pattern for SHM consisting of H2B(Ser14P) in the absence of gammaH2AX.},

Here we showed that Treg cell development was achieved by the combination of two independent processes, i.e., the expression of Foxp3 and the establishment of Treg cell-specific CpG hypomethylation pattern. Both events were induced by T~cell receptor stimulation. The Treg cell-type CpG hypomethylation began in the thymus and continued to proceed in the periphery and could be fully established without Foxp3. The hypomethylation was required for Foxp3+ T~cells to acquire Treg cell-type gene expression, lineage stability, and full suppressive activity. Thus, those T~cells in which the two events have concurrently occurred are developmentally set into the Treg cell lineage.

  abstract = {Follicular lymphoma is an incurable B cell malignancy characterized by the t(14;18) translocation and mutations affecting the epigenome. Although frequent gene mutations in key signaling pathways, including JAK-STAT, NOTCH and NF-κB, have also been defined, the spectrum of these mutations typically overlaps with that in the closely related diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Using a combination of discovery exome and extended targeted sequencing, we identified recurrent somatic mutations in RRAGC uniquely enriched in patients with follicular lymphoma (17\%). More than half of the mutations preferentially co-occurred with mutations in ATP6V1B2 and ATP6AP1, which encode components of the vacuolar H+-ATP ATPase (V-ATPase) known to be necessary for amino acid−induced activation of mTORC1. The RagC variants increased raptor binding while rendering mTORC1 signaling resistant to amino acid deprivation. The activating nature of the RRAGC mutations, their existence in the dominant clone and their stability during disease progression support their potential as an excellent candidate for therapeutic targeting.},

RNA binding contributes to TF function by promoting the dynamic association between DNA, RNA, and TF on chromatin. TF-RNA interactions are a conserved feature important for vertebrate development and disrupted in disease.

  abstract = {Purpose: Targeting malignant B cells using rituximab (anti-CD20) has improved the efficacy of chemotherapy regimens used to treat patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Despite the promising clinical results obtained using rituximab, many patients relapse with therapy-resistant disease following rituximab-based treatments. We have created a cell line model of rituximab resistance using three B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma–derived cell lines (Raji, RL, and SUDHL-4). In an attempt to define strategies to overcome rituximab resistance, we sought to determine the chemotherapy sensitivity of our rituximab-resistant cell lines (RRCL). Experimental Design: Parental, rituximab-sensitive cell lines (RSCL) Raji, RL, and SUDHL-4, along with RRCLs derived from them, were exposed to several chemotherapeutic agents with different mechanisms of action and the ability of these agents to induce apoptotic cell death was measured. Expression of multidomain Bcl-2 family proteins was studied as potential mediators of chemotherapy/rituximab resistance. Results: We found that RRCLs are resistant to multiple chemotherapeutic agents and have significantly decreased expression of the Bcl-2 family proteins Bax, Bak, and Bcl-2. RRCLs do not undergo rituximab- or chemotherapy-induced apoptosis but die in a caspase-dependent manner when either wild-type Bax or Bak is exogenously expressed. Furthermore, forced expression of Bak sensitized RRCL to chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. Conclusions: Whereas a single or limited exposure of lymphoma cells to rituximab may lead to a favorable ratio of proapoptotic to antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins, repeated exposure to rituximab is associated with a therapy-resistant phenotype via modulation of Bax and Bak expression.},

No treatment is available yet to effectively slow disease progression. Renal cyst growth is, at least in part, driven by the presence of growth factors in the lumens of renal cysts, which are enclosed spaces lacking connections to the tubular system. We have shown previously shown that IL13 in cyst fluid leads to aberrant activation of STAT6 via the IL4/13 receptor. Although antagonistic antibodies against many of the growth factors implicated in ADPKD are already available, they are IgG isotype antibodies that are not expected to gain access to renal cyst lumens. Here we demonstrate that targeting antibodies to renal cyst lumens is possible with the use of dimeric IgA (dIgA) antibodies. Using human ADPKD tissues and polycystic kidney disease mouse models, we show that the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR) is highly expressed by renal cyst-lining cells. pIgR expression is, in part, driven by aberrant STAT6 pathway activation. pIgR actively transports dIgA from the circulation across the cyst epithelium and releases it into the cyst lumen as secretory IgA. dIgA administered by intraperitoneal injection is preferentially targeted to polycystic kidneys whereas injected IgG is not. Our results suggest that pIgR-mediated transcytosis of antagonistic antibodies in dIgA format can be exploited for targeted therapy in ADPKD.},

Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting of lysates of BCL-6-expressing cells using both antibodies showed a broad 92- to 98- kD band. Dephosphorylation of BCL-6 protein reduced the size of this band to 87 kD, suggesting that BCL-6 may be expressed in a phosphorylated form. Immunostaining with both antibodies showed that BCL-6 protein was localized in the nuclei of most of the germinal center B cells and a small number of marginal zone B cells. Furthermore, BCL-6 protein was expressed in follicular, Burkitt's, and diffuse large B-cell lymphomas. These results suggest that the BCL-6 protein, expressed in B cells of the germinal centers which are important in the maturation of immune responses, may play some physiological role(s) in the germinal center B cells.},

We show that a Tet2/Tet3 conditional knockout at early stages of B-cell development largely prevents lineage-specific programmed demethylation events. This lack of demethylation affects the expression of nearby B-cell lineage genes by impairing enhancer activity, thus causing defects in B-cell differentiation and function.

A few long ncRNAs that have been studied in any detail silence gene expression in processes such as X-inactivation and imprinting. We used a GENCODE annotation of the human genome to characterize over a thousand long ncRNAs that are expressed in multiple cell lines. Unexpectedly, we found an enhancer-like function for a set of these long ncRNAs in human cell lines. Depletion of a number of ncRNAs led to decreased expression of their neighboring protein-coding genes, including the master regulator of hematopoiesis, SCL (also called TAL1), Snai1 and Snai2. Using heterologous transcription assays we demonstrated a requirement for the ncRNAs in activation of gene expression. These results reveal an unanticipated role for a class of long ncRNAs in activation of critical regulators of development and differentiation. PaperClip},

Here we show that KMT2D functions as a bona fide tumor suppressor and that its genetic ablation in B cells promotes lymphoma development in mice. KMT2D deficiency also delays germinal center involution and impedes B cell differentiation and class switch recombination. Integrative genomic analyses indicate that KMT2D affects methylation of lysine 4 on histone H3 (H3K4) and expression of a set of genes, including those in the CD40, JAK-STAT, Toll-like receptor and B cell receptor signaling pathways. Notably, other KMT2D target genes include frequently mutated tumor suppressor genes such as TNFAIP3, SOCS3 and TNFRSF14. Therefore, KMT2D mutations may promote malignant outgrowth by perturbing the expression of tumor suppressor genes that control B cell–activating pathways.},

  abstract = {The gene encoding the lysine-specific histone methyltransferase KMT2D has emerged as one of the most frequently mutated genes in follicular lymphoma and diffuse large B cell lymphoma; however, the biological consequences of KMT2D mutations on lymphoma development are not known. Here we show that KMT2D functions as a bona fide tumor suppressor and that its genetic ablation in B cells promotes lymphoma development in mice. KMT2D deficiency also delays germinal center involution and impedes B cell differentiation and class switch recombination. Integrative genomic analyses indicate that KMT2D affects methylation of lysine 4 on histone H3 (H3K4) and expression of a set of genes, including those in the CD40, JAK-STAT, Toll-like receptor and B cell receptor signaling pathways. Notably, other KMT2D target genes include frequently mutated tumor suppressor genes such as TNFAIP3, SOCS3 and TNFRSF14. Therefore, KMT2D mutations may promote malignant outgrowth by perturbing the expression of tumor suppressor genes that control B cell–activating pathways.},

Although deregulated gene expression has been extensively studied at genomic and epigenetic scales, the contribution of the regulation of mRNA-specific translation to this reprogramming is not well understood. Here we show that cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding protein 4 (CPEB4), an RNA binding protein that mediates meiotic mRNA cytoplasmic polyadenylation and translation, is overexpressed in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas and glioblastomas, where it supports tumor growth, vascularization and invasion. We also show that, in pancreatic tumors, the pro-oncogenic functions of CPEB4 originate in the translational activation of mRNAs that are silenced in normal tissue, including the mRNA of tissue plasminogen activator, a key contributor to pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma malignancy. Taken together, our results document a key role for post-transcriptional gene regulation in tumor development and describe a detailed mechanism for gene expression reprogramming underlying malignant tumor progression.},

We used the yeast tribrid system to identify downstream effectors of the phosphorylated FcepsilonRI ITAM-containing subunits beta and gamma. One novel cDNA was isolated that encodes a protein that is phosphorylated on tyrosine, contains a Src-homology 2 (SH2) domain, inositolpolyphosphate 5-phosphatase activity, three NXXY motifs, several proline-rich regions, and is called SHIP. Mutation of the conserved tyrosine or leucine residues within the FcepsilonRI beta or gamma ITAMs eliminates SHIP binding and indicates that the SHIP-ITAM interaction is specific. SHIP also binds to ITAMs from the CD3 complex and T cell receptor zeta chain in vitro. SHIP protein possesses both phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate 5'-phosphatase and inositol-1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate 5'-phosphatase activity. Phosphorylation of SHIP by a protein-tyrosine kinase, Lck, results in a reduction in enzyme activity. FcepsilonRI activation induces the association of several tyrosine phosphoproteins with SHIP. SHIP is constitutively tyrosine-phosphorylated and associated with Shc and Grb2. These data suggest that SHIP may serve as a multifunctional linker protein in receptor activation.},

  abstract = {IgM antibodies have been known for decades to enhance humoral immune responses in an antigen-specific fashion. This enhancement has been thought to be dependent on complement activation by IgM–antigen complexes; however, recent genetic studies render this mechanism unlikely. Here, we describe a likely alternative explanation; mice lacking the recently identified Fc receptor for IgM (FcμR) on B cells produced significantly less antibody to protein antigen during both primary and memory responses. This immune deficiency was accompanied by impaired germinal center formation and decreased plasma and memory B-cell generation. FcμR did not affect steady-state B-cell survival but specifically enhanced the survival and proliferation induced by B-cell receptor cross-linking. Moreover, FcμR-deficient mice produced far more autoantibodies than control mice as they aged, suggesting that FcμR is also required for maintaining tolerance to self-antigens. Our results thus define a unique pathway mediated by the FcμR for regulating immunity and tolerance and suggest that IgM antibodies promote humoral immune responses to foreign antigen yet suppress autoantibody production through at least two pathways: complement activation and FcμR.},

The TCR is rapidly internalized after antigen stimulation and then degraded in lysosomes. However, few of the molecules involved in this process have been identified. We demonstrate that the lysosomal protein LAPTM5 negatively regulated surface TCR expression by specifically interacting with the invariant signal-transducing CD3ζ chain and promoting its degradation without affecting other CD3 proteins, CD3ɛ, CD3δ, or CD3γ. TCR downmodulation required the polyproline-tyrosine motifs and the ubiquitin-interacting motif of LAPTM5. LAPTM5 deficiency resulted in elevated TCR expression on both CD4+CD8+ thymocytes and spleen T cells after CD3 stimulation, as well as enhanced T cell responses in vitro and in~vivo. These results identify a lysosomal protein important for CD3ζ degradation and illustrate a unique mechanism for the control of surface TCR expression and T cell activation.},

We found that B cells lacking the lysosomal-associated protein transmembrane 5 (LAPTM5) expressed higher levels of cell surface BCR than did wild-type (WT) B cells after Ag stimulation in vitro and in vivo. In addition, LAPTM5-deficient mice contained an increased frequency of Ag-specific B cells and produced greater amounts of Abs than did WT mice after immunization with a T-dependent Ag. Adoptive transfer of LAPTM5-deficient B cells with WT T cells into RAG1-deficient mice revealed that the increased surface BCR levels and the enhanced B cell activation and Ab production were due to a B cell intrinsic defect. As they aged, the LAPTM5-deficient mice had increased titers of serum IgM and autoantibodies and immune complex deposition in the kidney. Immunofluorescent and biochemical analysis revealed that LAPTM5 physically interacted with the BCR complex and promoted its degradation in the lysosomal compartment in mouse B cells.

Using IL-21-transgenic mice and hydrodynamics-based gene delivery of IL-21 plasmid DNA into wild-type mice as well as in vitro studies, we demonstrate that although IL-21 induces death of resting B cells, it promotes differentiation of B cells into postswitch and plasma cells. Thus, IL-21 differentially influences B cell fate depending on the signaling context, explaining how IL-21 can be proapoptotic for B cells in vitro yet critical for Ag-specific Ig production in vivo. Moreover, we demonstrate that IL-21 unexpectedly induces expression of both Blimp-1 and Bcl-6, indicating mechanisms as to how IL-21 can serve as a complex regulator of B cell maturation and terminal differentiation.

  abstract = {The bacterial CRISPR/Cas9 system allows sequence-specific gene editing in many organisms and holds promise as a tool to generate models of human diseases, for example, in human pluripotent stem cells. CRISPR/Cas9 introduces targeted double-stranded breaks (DSBs) with high efficiency, which are typically repaired by non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) resulting in nonspecific insertions, deletions or other mutations (indels). DSBs may also be repaired by homology-directed repair (HDR) using a DNA repair template, such as an introduced single-stranded oligo DNA nucleotide (ssODN), allowing knock-in of specific mutations. Although CRISPR/Cas9 is used extensively to engineer gene knockouts through NHEJ, editing by HDR remains inefficient and can be corrupted by additional indels, preventing its widespread use for modelling genetic disorders through introducing disease-associated mutations. Furthermore, targeted mutational knock-in at single alleles to model diseases caused by heterozygous mutations has not been reported. Here we describe a CRISPR/Cas9-based genome-editing framework that allows selective introduction of mono- and bi-allelic sequence changes with high efficiency and accuracy. We show that HDR accuracy is increased dramatically by incorporating silent CRISPR/Cas-blocking mutations along with pathogenic mutations, and establish a method termed ‘CORRECT’ for scarless genome editing. By characterizing and exploiting a stereotyped inverse relationship between a mutation’s incorporation rate and its distance to the DSB, we achieve predictable control of zygosity. Homozygous introduction requires a guide RNA targeting close to the intended mutation, whereas heterozygous introduction can be accomplished by distance-dependent suboptimal mutation incorporation or by use of mixed repair templates. Using this approach, we generated human induced pluripotent stem cells with heterozygous and homozygous dominant early onset Alzheimer’s disease-causing mutations in amyloid precursor protein (APPSwe) and presenilin 1 (PSEN1M146V) and derived cortical neurons, which displayed genotype-dependent disease-associated phenotypes. Our findings enable efficient introduction of specific sequence changes with CRISPR/Cas9, facilitating study of human disease.},

  abstract = {Metazoan development is regulated by transcriptional networks, which must respond to extracellular cues including cytokines. The JAK/STAT pathway is a highly conserved regulatory module, activated by many cytokines, in which tyrosine-phosphorylated STATs (pSTATs) function as transcription factors. However, the mechanisms by which STAT activation modulates lineage-affiliated transcriptional programs are unclear. We demonstrate that in the absence of thrombopoietin (TPO), tyrosine-unphosphorylated STAT5 (uSTAT5) is present in the nucleus where it colocalizes with CTCF and represses a megakaryocytic transcriptional program. TPO-mediated phosphorylation of STAT5 triggers its genome-wide relocation to STAT consensus sites with two distinct transcriptional consequences, loss of a uSTAT5 program that restrains megakaryocytic differentiation and activation of a canonical pSTAT5-driven program which includes regulators of apoptosis and proliferation. Transcriptional repression by uSTAT5 reflects restricted access of the megakaryocytic transcription factor ERG to target genes. These results identify a previously unrecognized mechanism of cytokine-mediated differentiation.},

  abstract = {Using high-throughput experiments, we determined the functional epigenomic landscape in pancreatic islet cells. Computational integration of these data along with similar data from the ENCODE project revealed the presence of large gene control elements across diverse cell types that we refer to as “stretch enhancers.” Stretch enhancers are cell type specific and are associated with increased expression of genes involved in cell-specific processes. We find that genetic variations associated with common disease are highly enriched in stretch enhancers; notably, stretch enhancers specific to pancreatic islets harbor variants linked to type 2 diabetes and related traits. We propose that stretch enhancers form as pluripotent cells differentiate into committed lineages, to program important cell-specific gene expression., Chromatin-based functional genomic analyses and genomewide association studies (GWASs) together implicate enhancers as critical elements influencing gene expression and risk for common diseases. Here, we performed systematic chromatin and transcriptome profiling in human pancreatic islets. Integrated analysis of islet data with those from nine cell types identified specific and significant enrichment of type 2 diabetes and related quantitative trait GWAS variants in islet enhancers. Our integrated chromatin maps reveal that most enhancers are short (median = 0.8 kb). Each cell type also contains a substantial number of more extended (≥3 kb) enhancers. Interestingly, these stretch enhancers are often tissue-specific and overlap locus control regions, suggesting that they are important chromatin regulatory beacons. Indeed, we show that (i) tissue specificity of enhancers and nearby gene expression increase with enhancer length; (ii) neighborhoods containing stretch enhancers are enriched for important cell type–specific genes; and (iii) GWAS variants associated with traits relevant to a particular cell type are more enriched in stretch enhancers compared with short enhancers. Reporter constructs containing stretch enhancer sequences exhibited tissue-specific activity in cell culture experiments and in transgenic mice. These results suggest that stretch enhancers are critical chromatin elements for coordinating cell type–specific regulatory programs and that sequence variation in stretch enhancers affects risk of major common human diseases.},

We find that genetic variations associated with common disease are highly enriched in stretch enhancers; notably, stretch enhancers specific to pancreatic islets harbor variants linked to type 2 diabetes and related traits. We propose that stretch enhancers form as pluripotent cells differentiate into committed lineages, to program important cell-specific gene expression., Chromatin-based functional genomic analyses and genomewide association studies (GWASs) together implicate enhancers as critical elements influencing gene expression and risk for common diseases. Here, we performed systematic chromatin and transcriptome profiling in human pancreatic islets. Integrated analysis of islet data with those from nine cell types identified specific and significant enrichment of type 2 diabetes and related quantitative trait GWAS variants in islet enhancers. Our integrated chromatin maps reveal that most enhancers are short (median = 0.8 kb). Each cell type also contains a substantial number of more extended (≥3 kb) enhancers. Interestingly, these stretch enhancers are often tissue-specific and overlap locus control regions, suggesting that they are important chromatin regulatory beacons. Indeed, we show that (i) tissue specificity of enhancers and nearby gene expression increase with enhancer length; (ii) neighborhoods containing stretch enhancers are enriched for important cell type–specific genes; and (iii) GWAS variants associated with traits relevant to a particular cell type are more enriched in stretch enhancers compared with short enhancers. Reporter constructs containing stretch enhancer sequences exhibited tissue-specific activity in cell culture experiments and in transgenic mice. These results suggest that stretch enhancers are critical chromatin elements for coordinating cell type–specific regulatory programs and that sequence variation in stretch enhancers affects risk of major common human diseases.},

These cellular transitions take place in a stepwise manner and are regulated at the transcriptional level. In recent years, investigators working in this field have made significant advances towards understanding the contribution of transcription factors during B lymphopoiesis. They have established the existence of transcription factor networks that are essential for the proper establishment and maintenance of the B cell lineage. As is the case for other developmental processes, emerging evidence demonstrates that B cell development is also regulated at the epigenetic level and that such regulation may act in concert with transcription factors. The aim of this review is to summarize the current knowledge concerning the epigenetic events that contribute to B lymphopoiesis.},

Short-tandem-repeat (STR) profiling (DNA fingerprinting) is the method of choice for this purpose; however, the genetic stability of cell lines under various experimental conditions is not well defined. We tested the effect of long-term culture, subcloning, and generation of drug-resistant subclones on fingerprinting profiles in four widely used leukemia cell lines. The DNA fingerprinting profile remained unaltered in two of them (U937 and K562) throughout 12 months in culture, and the vast majority of subclones derived therefrom by limiting dilution after long-term culture revealed the same profile, indicating a high degree of stability and clonotypic homogeneity. In contrast, two other cell lines (CCRF-CEM and Jurkat) showed marked alterations in DNA fingerprinting profiles during long-term culture. Limiting dilution subcloning revealed extensive clonotypic heterogeneity with subclones differing in up to eight STR loci from the parental culture. Similar heterogeneity was observed in subclones generated by selection culture for drug resistance where DNA fingerprinting proved useful in identifying possible resistance mechanisms. Thus, common tissue culture procedures may dramatically affect the fingerprinting profile of certain cell lines and thus render definition of their origin difficult.},

  abstract = {Type 2 diabetes affects over 300 million people, causing severe complications and premature death, yet the underlying molecular mechanisms are largely unknown. Pancreatic islet dysfunction is central for type 2 diabetes pathogenesis, and therefore understanding islet genome regulation could provide valuable mechanistic insights. We have now mapped and examined the function of human islet cis-regulatory networks. We identify genomic sequences that are targeted by islet transcription factors to drive islet-specific gene activity, and show that most such sequences reside in clusters of enhancers that form physical 3D chromatin domains. We find that sequence variants associated with type 2 diabetes and fasting glycemia are enriched in these clustered islet enhancers, and identify trait-associated variants that disrupt DNA-binding and islet enhancer activity. Our studies illustrate how islet transcription factors interact functionally with the epigenome, and provide systematic evidence that dysregulation of islet enhancers is relevant to the mechanisms underlying type 2 diabetes.},

  abstract = {Most human B cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (B-NHLs) derive from germinal centers (GCs), the structure in which B cells undergo somatic hypermutation (SHM) and class switch recombination (CSR) before being selected for high-affinity antibody production. The pathogenesis of B-NHL is associated with distinct genetic lesions, including chromosomal translocations and aberrant SHM, which arise from mistakes occurring during CSR and SHM. A direct link between these DNA remodeling events and GC lymphoma development, however, has not been demonstrated. Here we have crossed three mouse models of B cell lymphoma driven by oncogenes (Myc, Bcl6 and Myc/Bcl6; refs. 5,6) with mice lacking activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID), the enzyme required for both CSR and SHM. We show that AID deficiency prevents Bcl6-dependent, GC-derived B-NHL, but has no impact on Myc-driven, pre-GC lymphomas. Accordingly, abrogation of AID is associated with the disappearance of CSR- and SHM-mediated structural alterations. These results show that AID is required for GC-derived lymphomagenesis, supporting the notion that errors in AID-mediated antigen-receptor gene modification processes are principal contributors to the pathogenesis of human B-NHL.},

  abstract = {Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), the most frequent subtype of lymphoid malignancy, remains a significant clinical challenge, as ∼30\% of patients are not cured. Over the past decade, remarkable progress has been made in the understanding of the pathogenesis of this disease, spurred by the implementation of powerful genomic technologies that enabled the definition of its genetic and epigenetic landscape. These studies have uncovered a multitude of genomic alterations that contribute to the initiation and maintenance of the tumor clone by disrupting biological functions known to be critical for the normal biology of its cells of origin, germinal center B cells. The identified alterations involve epigenetic remodeling, block of differentiation, escape from immune surveillance, and the constitutive activation of several signal transduction pathways. This wealth of new information offers unique opportunities for the development of improved diagnostic and prognostic tools that could help guide the clinical management of DLBCL patients. Furthermore, a number of the mutated genes identified are potentially actionable targets that are currently being explored for the development of novel therapeutic strategies. This review summarizes current knowledge of the most common genetic alterations associated with DLBCL in relation to their functional impact on the malignant transformation process, and discusses their clinical implications for mechanism-based therapeutics.},

  abstract = {Follicular lymphoma (FL) is an indolent disease, but 30-40\% of cases undergo histologic transformation to an aggressive malignancy, typically represented by diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL). The pathogenesis of this process remains largely unknown. Using whole-exome sequencing and copy-number analysis, here we show that the dominant clone of FL and transformed FL (tFL) arise by divergent evolution from a common mutated precursor through the acquisition of distinct genetic events. Mutations in epigenetic modifiers and anti-apoptotic genes are introduced early in the common precursor, while tFL is specifically associated with alterations deregulating cell-cycle progression and DNA-damage responses (CDKN2A/B, MYC, TP53), as well as with aberrant somatic hypermutation. The genomic profile of tFL shares similarities with that of germinal center B-cell-type de novo DLBCL, but also displays unique combinations of altered genes, with diagnostic and therapeutic implications.},

  abstract = {Resistance to aromatase inhibitors (AIs) is a major clinical problem in the treatment of estrogen receptor (ER)–positive breast cancer. In two breast cancer cell line models of AI resistance, we identified widespread DNA hyper- and hypomethylation, with enrichment for promoter hypermethylation of developmental genes. For the homeobox gene HOXC10, methylation occurred in a CpG shore, which overlapped with a functional ER binding site, causing repression of HOXC10 expression. Although short-term blockade of ER signaling caused relief of HOXC10 repression in both cell lines and breast tumors, it also resulted in concurrent recruitment of EZH2 and increased H3K27me3, ultimately transitioning to increased DNA methylation and silencing of HOXC10. Reduced HOXC10 in vitro and in xenografts resulted in decreased apoptosis and caused antiestrogen resistance. Supporting this, we used paired primary and metastatic breast cancer specimens to show that HOXC10 was reduced in tumors that recurred during AI treatment. We propose a model in which estrogen represses apoptotic and growth-inhibitory genes such as HOXC10, contributing to tumor survival, whereas AIs induce these genes to cause apoptosis and therapeutic benefit, but long-term AI treatment results in permanent repression of these genes via methylation and confers resistance. Therapies aimed at inhibiting AI-induced histone and DNA methylation may be beneficial in blocking or delaying AI resistance.},

The resulting fusion protein, PML-RARA, initiates APL, which is a subtype (M3) of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In this report, we identify a gene expression signature that is specific to M3 samples; it was not found in other AML subtypes and did not simply represent the normal gene expression pattern of primary promyelocytes. To validate this signature for a large number of genes, we tested a recently developed high throughput digital technology (NanoString nCounter). Nearly all of the genes tested demonstrated highly significant concordance with our microarray data (P {$<$} 0.05). The validated gene signature reliably identified M3 samples in 2 other AML datasets, and the validated genes were substantially enriched in our mouse model of APL, but not in a cell line that inducibly expressed PML-RARA. These results demonstrate that nCounter is a highly reproducible, customizable system for mRNA quantification using limited amounts of clinical material, which provides a valuable tool for biomarker measurement in low-abundance patient samples.},

  abstract = {Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a disease with variable clinical outcome. Several prognostic factors such as the immunoglobulin heavy chain variable genes (IGHV) mutation status are linked to the B-cell receptor (BCR) complex, supporting a role for triggering the BCR in vivo in the pathogenesis. The miRNA profile upon stimulation and correlation with IGHV mutation status is however unknown. To evaluate the transcriptional response of peripheral blood CLL cells upon BCR stimulation in vitro, miRNA and mRNA expression was measured using hybridization arrays and qPCR. We found both IGHV mutated and unmutated CLL cells to respond with increased expression of MYC and other genes associated with BCR activation, and a phenotype of cell cycle progression. Genome-wide expression studies showed hsa-miR-132-3p/hsa-miR-212 miRNA cluster induction associated with a set of downregulated genes, enriched for genes modulated by BCR activation and amplified by Myc. We conclude that BCR triggering of CLL cells induces a transcriptional response of genes associated with BCR activation, enhanced cell cycle entry and progression and suggest that part of the transcriptional profiles linked to IGHV mutation status observed in isolated peripheral blood are not cell intrinsic but rather secondary to in vivo BCR stimulation.},

  abstract = {The vast majority of the mammalian genome has the potential to express noncoding RNA (ncRNA). The 11-subunit RNA exosome complex is the main source of cellular 3′–5′ exoribonucleolytic activity and potentially regulates the mammalian noncoding transcriptome. Here we generated a mouse model in which the essential subunit Exosc3 of the RNA exosome complex can be conditionally deleted. Exosc3-deficient B cells lack the ability to undergo normal levels of class switch recombination and somatic hypermutation, two mutagenic DNA processes used to generate antibody diversity via the B-cell mutator protein activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID). The transcriptome of Exosc3-deficient B cells has revealed the presence of many novel RNA exosome substrate ncRNAs. RNA exosome substrate RNAs include xTSS-RNAs, transcription start site (TSS)-associated antisense transcripts that can exceed 500 base pairs in length and are transcribed divergently from cognate coding gene transcripts. xTSS-RNAs are most strongly expressed at genes that accumulate AID-mediated somatic mutations and/or are frequent translocation partners of DNA double-strand breaks generated at Igh in B cells. Strikingly, translocations near TSSs or within gene bodies occur over regions of RNA exosome substrate ncRNA expression. These RNA exosome-regulated, antisense-transcribed regions of the B-cell genome recruit AID and accumulate single-strand DNA structures containing RNA–DNA hybrids. We propose that RNA exosome regulation of ncRNA recruits AID to single-strand DNA-forming sites of antisense and divergent transcription in the B-cell genome, thereby creating a link between ncRNA transcription and overall maintenance of B-cell genomic integrity.},

Unexpectedly, eRNA-expressing regions accumulate R-loop structures upon RNA exosome ablation, thus demonstrating the role of RNA exosome in resolving deleterious DNA/RNA hybrids arising from~active enhancers. We have uncovered a distal divergent eRNA-expressing element (lncRNA-CSR) engaged in long-range DNA interactions and regulating IgH 3′ regulatory region super-enhancer function. CRISPR-Cas9-mediated ablation of lncRNA-CSR transcription decreases its chromosomal looping-mediated association with the IgH 3′~regulatory region super-enhancer and leads to decreased class switch recombination efficiency. We propose that the RNA exosome protects divergently transcribed lncRNA expressing enhancers by resolving deleterious transcription-coupled secondary DNA structures, while also regulating long-range super-enhancer chromosomal interactions important for cellular function.},

  abstract = {The sex determination transcription factor SRY is a cell fate-determining transcription factor that mediates testis differentiation during embryogenesis. It may function by repressing the ovarian determinant gene, RSPO1, action in the ovarian developmental pathway and activates genes, such as SOX9, important for testis differentiation at the onset of gonadogenesis. Further, altered expression of SRY and related SOX genes contribute to oncogenesis in many human cancers. Little is known of the mechanisms by which SRY regulates its target genes. Recently a KRAB domain protein (KRAB-O) that lacks a zinc finger motif has been demonstrated to interact with SRY and hypothesized to function as an adaptor molecule for SRY by tethering the KAP1-NuRD-SETDB1-HP1 silencing machinery to repress SRY targets. We have critically examined this hypothesis by reconstituting and characterizing SRY-KRAB-O-KAP1 interactions. These recombinant molecules can form a ternary complex by direct and high affinity interactions. The KRAB-O protein can simultaneously bind KAP1 and SRY in a noncompetitive but also noncooperative manner. An extensive mutagenesis analysis suggests that different surfaces on KRAB-O are utilized for these independent interactions. Transcriptional repression by SRY requires binding to KRAB-O, thus bridging to the KAP1 repression machinery. This repression machinery is recruited to SRY target promoters in chromatin templates via SRY. These results suggest that SRY has co-opted the KRAB-O protein to recruit the KAP1 repression machinery to sex determination target genes. Other KRAB domain proteins, which lack a zinc finger DNA-binding motif, may function in similar roles as adaptor proteins for epigenetic gene silencing.},

  abstract = {SDF-1 and CXCR4 are a chemokine and chemokine receptor pair playing critical roles in tumorigenesis. Overexpression of CXCR4 is a hallmark of many hematological malignancies including acute myeloid leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, and generally correlates with a poor prognosis. In this study, we developed a humanized anti-CXCR4 monoclonal antibody, LY2624587 as a potent CXCR4 antagonist that was advanced into clinical study for cancer. LY2624587 blocked SDF-1 binding to CXCR4 with an IC50 of 0.26 nM, and inhibited SDF-1-induced GTP binding with a Kb of 0.66 nM. In human lymphoma U937 and leukemia CCRF-CEM cells expressing endogenous CXCR4, LY2624587 inhibited SDF-1-induced cell migration with IC50 values of 3.7 and 0.26 nM, respectively. This antibody also inhibited CXCR4 and SDF-1 mediated cell signaling including activation of MAPK and AKT in tumor cells expressing CXCR4. Bifocal microscopic and flow cytometry analyses revealed that LY2624587 mediated receptor internalization and caused CXCR4 down-regulation on the cell surface. In human hematologic cancer cells, LY2624587 caused dose dependent apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. In mouse xenograft models developed with human leukemia and lymphoma cells expressing high levels of CXCR4, LY2624587 exhibited dose-dependent tumor growth inhibition and provided significant survival benefit in a disseminated lymphoma model. Collectively, we have demonstrated that CXCR4 inhibition by LY2624587 has the potential for the treatment of human hematological malignancies.},

  abstract = {Promoters are DNA sequences that have an essential role in controlling gene expression. While recent whole cancer genome analyses have identified numerous hotspots of somatic point mutations within promoters, many have not yet been shown to perturb gene expression or drive cancer development. As such, positive selection alone may not adequately explain the frequency of promoter point mutations in cancer genomes. Here we show that increased mutation density at gene promoters can be linked to promoter activity and differential nucleotide excision repair (NER). By analysing 1,161 human cancer genomes across 14 cancer types, we find evidence for increased local density of somatic point mutations within the centres of DNase I-hypersensitive sites (DHSs) in gene promoters. Mutated DHSs were strongly associated with transcription initiation activity, in which active promoters but not enhancers of equal DNase I hypersensitivity were most mutated relative to their flanking regions. Notably, analysis of genome-wide maps of NER shows that NER is impaired within the DHS centre of active gene promoters, while XPC-deficient skin cancers do not show increased promoter mutation density, pinpointing differential NER as the underlying cause of these mutation hotspots. Consistent with this finding, we observe that melanomas with an ultraviolet-induced DNA damage mutation signature show greatest enrichment of promoter mutations, whereas cancers that are not highly dependent on NER, such as colon cancer, show no sign of such enrichment. Taken together, our analysis has uncovered the presence of a previously unknown mechanism linking transcription initiation and NER as a major contributor of somatic point mutation hotspots at active gene promoters in cancer genomes.},

  abstract = {Skeletal muscle exhibits a high plasticity and accordingly can quickly adapt to different physiological and pathological stimuli by changing its phenotype largely through diverse epigenetic mechanisms. The nuclear receptor corepressor 1 (NCoR1) has the ability to mediate gene repression; however, its role in regulating biological programs in skeletal muscle is still poorly understood. We therefore studied the mechanistic and functional aspects of NCoR1 function in this tissue. NCoR1 muscle-specific knockout mice exhibited a 7.2\% higher peak oxygen consumption (VO2peak), a 11\% reduction in maximal isometric force, and increased ex vivo fatigue resistance during maximal stimulation. Interestingly, global gene expression analysis revealed a high overlap between the effects of NCoR1 deletion and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) coactivator 1α (PGC-1α) overexpression on oxidative metabolism in muscle. Importantly, PPARβ/δ and estrogen-related receptor α (ERRα) were identified as common targets of NCoR1 and PGC-1α with opposing effects on the transcriptional activity of these nuclear receptors. In fact, the repressive effect of NCoR1 on oxidative phosphorylation gene expression specifically antagonizes PGC-1α-mediated coactivation of ERRα. We therefore delineated the molecular mechanism by which a transcriptional network controlled by corepressor and coactivator proteins determines the metabolic properties of skeletal muscle, thus representing a potential therapeutic target for metabolic diseases.},

In this study, we compared the functional responses of total (CD19+) and memory B cells (Bmem; CD19+/CD27+) isolated from blood and tonsils to different stimuli. Peripheral B cells showed enhanced survival and proliferation compared with their tonsillar equivalents when stimulated for 10 days. Stimulated B cells from both tissues secreted significantly greater amounts of cytokines than unstimulated controls demonstrating their functional responsiveness. Analysis of CD27 expression over time indicated that the conditions that promoted survival and proliferation of peripheral Bmem, caused massive tonsillar Bmem death. Purified tonsillar Bmem failed to expand but rapidly differentiated in antibody secreting cells and subsequently underwent apoptosis. In contrast, circulating Bmem showed delayed activation and differentiation, but exhibited a longer lifespan and active proliferation. In addition, short-term stimulation of tonsillar Bmem resulted in the production of more immunoglobulin G (IgG) than their peripheral counterparts. At later time points, however, IgG production from the different B cells was reversed. Our findings imply that the tissue located and peripheral Bmem have distinct behaviors, indicating organ dependent functional responses that should not be generalizable to all Bmem. This work provides a greater understanding of how Bmem location is coupled to specialized roles of B lymphocytes.},

  abstract = {Background The genus Microbotryum includes plant pathogenic fungi afflicting a wide variety of hosts with anther smut disease. Microbotryum lychnidis-dioicae infects Silene latifolia and replaces host pollen with fungal spores, exhibiting biotrophy and necrosis associated with altering plant development. Results We determined the haploid genome sequence for M. lychnidis-dioicae and analyzed whole transcriptome data from plant infections and other stages of the fungal lifecycle, revealing the inventory and expression level of genes that facilitate pathogenic growth. Compared to related fungi, an expanded number of major facilitator superfamily transporters and secretory lipases were detected; lipase gene expression was found to be altered by exposure to lipid compounds, which signaled a switch to dikaryotic, pathogenic growth. In addition, while enzymes to digest cellulose, xylan, xyloglucan, and highly substituted forms of pectin were absent, along with depletion of peroxidases and superoxide dismutases that protect the fungus from oxidative stress, the repertoire of glycosyltransferases and of enzymes that could manipulate host development has expanded. A total of 14 \% of the genome was categorized as repetitive sequences. Transposable elements have accumulated in mating-type chromosomal regions and were also associated across the genome with gene clusters of small secreted proteins, which may mediate host interactions. Conclusions The unique absence of enzyme classes for plant cell wall degradation and maintenance of enzymes that break down components of pollen tubes and flowers provides a striking example of biotrophic host adaptation.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Biomarkers are required for pre-symptomatic diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is a favored source because its proteome reflects the composition of the brain. Ideal biomarkers have low technical and inter-individual variability (subject variance) among control subjects to minimize overlaps between clinical groups. This study evaluates a process of multi-affinity fractionation (MAF) and quantitative label-free liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) for CSF biomarker discovery by (1) identifying reparable sources of technical variability, (2) assessing subject variance and residual technical variability for numerous CSF proteins, and (3) testing its ability to segregate samples on the basis of desired biomarker characteristics. METHODS/RESULTS: Fourteen aliquots of pooled CSF and two aliquots from six cognitively normal individuals were randomized, enriched for low-abundance proteins by MAF, digested endoproteolytically, randomized again, and analyzed by nano-LC-MS. Nano-LC-MS data were time and m/z aligned across samples for relative peptide quantification. Among 11,433 aligned charge groups, 1360 relatively abundant ones were annotated by MS2, yielding 823 unique peptides. Analyses, including Pearson correlations of annotated LC-MS ion chromatograms, performed for all pairwise sample comparisons, identified several sources of technical variability: i) incomplete MAF and keratins; ii) globally- or segmentally-decreased ion current in isolated LC-MS analyses; and iii) oxidized methionine-containing peptides. Exclusion of these sources yielded 609 peptides representing 81 proteins. Most of these proteins showed very low coefficients of variation (CV{$<$}5\%) whether they were quantified from the mean of all or only the 2 most-abundant peptides. Unsupervised clustering, using only 24 proteins selected for high subject variance, yielded perfect segregation of pooled and individual samples. CONCLUSIONS: Quantitative label-free LC-MS/MS can measure scores of CSF proteins with low technical variability and can segregate samples according to desired criteria. Thus, this technique shows potential for biomarker discovery for neurological diseases.},

Numerous studies have documented the fidelity of these expression patterns, even when embryos are subjected to genetic or environmental stress, but the underlying mechanisms for this transcriptional precision are uncertain. Here we present evidence that every gap gene contains multiple enhancers with overlapping activities to produce authentic patterns of gene expression. For example, a recently identified hunchback (hb) enhancer (located 5-kb upstream of the classic enhancer) ensures repression at the anterior pole. The combination of intronic and 5′ knirps (kni) enhancers produces a faithful expression pattern, even though the intronic enhancer alone directs an abnormally broad expression pattern. We present different models for “enhancer synergy,” whereby two enhancers with overlapping activities produce authentic patterns of gene expression.},

SWI3 encodes a 99 kd nuclear protein containing a large, highly acidic N-terminal domain. SWI1 is identical to ADR6, which encodes a positive regulator of ADH1 and ADH2. Transcription of HO also requires SNF5 and SNF6. These and other observations suggest that SWI1, SWI2, SWI3, SNF5, and SNF6 may be components of a large multi-subunit complex.

  abstract = {The most common mutations in cancer are C to T transitions, but their origin has remained elusive. Recently, mutational signatures of APOBEC-family cytosine deaminases were identified in many common cancers, suggesting off-target deamination of cytosine to uracil as a common mutagenic mechanism. Here we present evidence from mass spectrometric quantitation of deoxyuridine in DNA that shows significantly higher genomic uracil content in B-cell lymphoma cell lines compared to non-lymphoma cancer cell lines and normal circulating lymphocytes. The genomic uracil levels were highly correlated with AID mRNA and protein expression, but not with expression of other APOBECs. Accordingly, AID knockdown significantly reduced genomic uracil content. B-cells stimulated to express endogenous AID and undergo class switch recombination displayed a several-fold increase in total genomic uracil, indicating that B cells may undergo widespread cytosine deamination after stimulation. In line with this, we found that clustered mutations (kataegis) in lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia predominantly carry AID-hotspot mutational signatures. Moreover, we observed an inverse correlation of genomic uracil with uracil excision activity and expression of the uracil-DNA glycosylases UNG and SMUG1. In conclusion, AID-induced mutagenic U:G mismatches in DNA may be a fundamental and common cause of mutations in B-cell malignancies.},

  abstract = {SummaryBackground The role of rituximab in combination with different CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone)-like chemotherapy regimens in young patients with good-prognosis diffuse large-B-cell lymphoma remains to be defined. We aimed to compare CHOP-like chemotherapy and rituximab with CHOP-like chemotherapy alone in these patients. Methods 824 patients who were from 18 countries; aged 18–60 years; and who had no risk factors or one risk factor according to age-adjusted International Prognostic Index (IPI), stage II–IV disease, or stage I disease with bulk were enrolled. These patients were randomly assigned to six cycles of CHOP-like chemotherapy and rituximab (n=413) or to six cycles of CHOP-like chemotherapy alone (n=411). Bulky and extranodal sites received additional radiotherapy. The primary endpoint was event-free survival; secondary endpoints were response, progression under therapy, progression-free survival, overall survival, and frequency of toxic effects. Analyses were done by intention to treat and per protocol. This trial is registered at http://www.clinicaltrials.gov, NCT 00064116. Findings After a median follow-up of 34 months (range 0·03–61), patients assigned chemotherapy and rituximab had increased 3-year event-free survival compared with those assigned chemotherapy alone (79\% [95\% CI 75–83] vs 59\% [54–64]; difference between groups 20\% [13–27], log-rank p\&lt;0·0001), and had increased 3-year overall survival (93\% [90–95] vs 84\% [80–88]; difference between groups 9\% [3–13], log-rank p=0·0001). Event-free survival was affected by treatment group, presence of bulky disease, and age-adjusted IPI: after chemotherapy and rituximab, a favourable subgroup (ie, IPI=0, no bulk) could be defined from a less-favourable subgroup (ie, IPI=1 or bulk, or both). Groups did not differ in the frequency of adverse events. Interpretation Rituximab added to six cycles of CHOP is an effective treatment for young patients with good-prognosis diffuse large-B-cell lymphoma. The definition of two prognostic subgroups allows for a more refined therapeutic approach for these patients.},

Work over the past decade has provided a fairly comprehensive understanding of the developmental pathways that determine the identity of major neuronal classes within the neural tube. However, the steps through which neurons acquire the subtype diversities necessary for their incorporation into a particular circuit are still poorly defined. Studies on the specification of motor neurons indicate that the large family of Hox transcription factors has a key role in generating the subtypes required for selective muscle innervation. There is also emerging evidence that Hox genes function in multiple neuronal classes to shape synaptic specificity during development, suggesting a broader role in circuit assembly. This review highlights the functions and mechanisms of Hox gene networks, and their multifaceted roles during neuronal specification and connectivity.},

  abstract = {T560, a mouse B lymphoma that originated in gut-associated lymphoid tissue, expresses receptors that bind dimeric IgA and IgM in a mutually inhibitory manner but have little affinity for monomeric IgA. Evidence presented in this paper indicates that the receptor is poly-Ig receptor (pIgR) known in humans and domestic cattle to bind both IgA and IgM. The evidence includes the demonstration that binding of IgM is J chain dependent, and that pIg-precipitated receptor has an appropriate Mr of 116–120 kDa and can be detected on immunoblots with specific rabbit anti-mouse pIgR. Overlapping RT-PCR performed using template mRNA from T560 cells and oligonucleotide primer pairs designed from the published sequence of mouse liver pIgR indicate that T560 cells express mRNA virtually identical with that of the epithelial cell pIgR throughout its external, transmembrane, and intracytoplasmic coding regions. Studies using mutant IgAs suggest that the Cα2 domain of dimeric IgA is not involved in high-affinity binding to the T560 pIgR. Inasmuch as this mouse B cell pIgR binds IgM better than IgA, it is similar to human pIgR and differs from rat, mouse, and rabbit epithelial cell pIgRs that bind IgA but not IgM. Possible explanations for this difference are discussed. All clones of T560 contain some cells that spontaneously secrete both IgG2a and IgA, but all of the IgA recoverable from the medium and from cell lysates is monomeric; it cannot be converted to secretory IgA by T560 cells.},

Here we re-evaluate data supporting these roles in the context of mechanistic insights provided by recent genome-wide studies and highlight evidence for CTCF-mediated intra- and inter-chromosomal contacts at several developmentally regulated genomic loci. These analyses support a primary role for CTCF in the global organization of chromatin architecture and suggest that CTCF may be a heritable component of an epigenetic system regulating the interplay between DNA methylation, higher-order chromatin structure, and lineage-specific gene expression.},

  abstract = {Depsipeptide (FK228) is a novel histone deacetylase inhibitor currently in clinical trials and the first to demonstrate clinical activity in patients. Responses have been observed in patients with T-cell lymphomas, despite prior treatment with multiple chemotherapeutic agents. To better understand the effects of histone deacetylase inhibitors on T-cell lymphoma, the human T-cell lymphoma cell line HUT78 was tested for sensitivity and molecular response to depsipeptide. Treatment with depsipeptide, as well as other histone deacetylase inhibitors, caused induction of histone acetylation, induction of p21 expression, and substantial apoptosis without significant cell cycle arrest. Treatment with the caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk significantly inhibited depsipeptide-induced apoptosis, enabling detection of cell cycle arrest. Treatment with depsipeptide increased expression of the interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor, and combination with the IL-2 toxin conjugate denileukin diftitox resulted in more than additive toxicity. Cells selected for resistance to depsipeptide overexpressed the multidrug resistance pump, P-glycoprotein (Pgp). However, cells selected for resistance to depsipeptide in the presence of a Pgp inhibitor had a Pgp-independent mechanism of resistance. These studies confirm the activity of depsipeptide in a T-cell lymphoma model and suggest a general sensitivity of T-cell lymphoma to histone deacetylase inhibitors, an emerging new class of anticancer agents.

  abstract = {Chromatin states are highly cell-type–specific, but the underlying mechanisms for the establishment and maintenance of their genome-wide patterns remain poorly understood. Here we present a computational approach for investigation of chromatin-state plasticity. We applied this approach to investigate an ENCODE ChIP-seq dataset profiling the genome-wide distributions of the H3K27me3 mark in 19 human cell lines. We found that the high plasticity regions (HPRs) can be divided into two functionally and mechanistically distinct subsets, which correspond to CpG island (CGI) proximal or distal regions, respectively. Although the CGI proximal HPRs are typically associated with continuous variation across different cell-types, the distal HPRs are associated with binary-like variations. We developed a computational approach to predict putative cell-type–specific modulators of H3K27me3 patterns and validated the predictions by comparing with public ChIP-seq data. Furthermore, we applied this approach to investigate mechanisms for poised enhancer establishment in primary human erythroid precursors. Importantly, we predicted and experimentally validated that the principal hematopoietic regulator T-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia-1 (TAL1) is involved in regulating H3K27me3 variations in collaboration with the transcription factor growth factor independent 1B (GFI1B), providing fresh insights into the context-specific role of TAL1 in erythropoiesis. Our approach is generally applicable to investigate the regulatory mechanisms of epigenetic pathways in establishing cellular identity.},

A greater part of this archived material, however, consists of solid tumors known for aberrations in coding and non-coding regions of the genome. Therefore, alterations of short tandem repeats (STRs) used in forensic casework are also possible. In our study of 118 solid tumors, 46 lymph node metastases, and 16 distant metastases with the AmpFlSTR trade mark Profiler Plus PCR amplification kit comprising nine STR loci, we detected four kinds of changes between normal and tumor tissue: partial loss of one allele (pLOH), complete loss of one allele (LOH), occurrence of an additional allele and occurrence of a new allele instead of that found in normal tissue. Twenty-two percent of the tumor lesions displayed pLOH, but only in 14\% one allele was completely lost. New alleles could be demonstrated in 18\% of tumors, and in 8\% the new allele in the tumor tissue replaced the one found in normal tissue. The changes were distributed over all nine STRs, but the STRs mostly affected were FGA, D3S1558, D18S51 and D21S11. The occurrence of new alleles in the tetra-nucleotide repeats correlated mainly with microsatellite instability in di-nucleotide and mono-nucleotide repeats. The occurrence of new alleles was most frequent in primary tumors of colon carcinomas and HNSCC metastases. In melanomas, only loss of alleles could be found. Our results demonstrate that the use of tumor tissue in forensic identification and paternity testing is questionable, especially if only tumors with known microsatellite instability are available.},

  abstract = {Germinal center (GC) B cells undergo somatic hypermutation, class switch recombination, and rapid clonal expansion to produce high-affinity antibodies. The BCL6 transcriptional repressor facilitates this phenotype because it can repress DNA damage checkpoint genes. GC B and T cells can make transient direct physical contact; T cells were observed to be associated with dead B-cell fragments. We thus hypothesized that one function of CD40 signaling from T cells within this timeframe could be to modulate BCL6 activity. CD40 signaling rapidly disrupts the ability of BCL6 to recruit the SMRT corepressor complex by excluding it from the nucleus, leading to histone acetylation, RNA polymerase II processivity, and activation of BCL6 target genes, such as CD23b, ATR, and TP53. Washout of CD40 to emulate transient T-cell contact permitted BCL6 target gene mRNA levels to return to their repressed levels, demonstrating that this is a reversible process, which could allow centroblasts that pass quality control to either continue proliferation or undergo terminal differentiation. These data suggest that transient CD40 signaling in the GC might allow T cells to weed out heavily damaged centroblasts while at the same time promoting survival of intact B cells, which could undergo differentiation or additional rounds of proliferation.},

Conversely, we discuss how the molecular similarities of DLBCL and FL have provided insight into the potential of both DLBCL and FL cases to respond to agents targeting alterations they have in common.

TLRs and BCR synergize to induce CSR in T cell-dependent and T cell-independent antibody responses to microbial pathogens. BCR triggering together with simultaneous endosomal TLR engagement leads to enhanced B cell differentiation and antibody responses. The requirement of both BCR and TLR engagement would ensure appropriate antigen-specific activation in an infection. Co-stimulation of TLRs and BCR likely plays a significant role in anti-microbial antibody responses to contain pathogen loads until the T cell-dependent antibody responses peak. Furthermore, the temporal sequence of different signals is also critical for optimal B cell responses, as exemplified by the activation of B cells by initial TLR engagement, leading to the upregulation of co-stimulatory CD80 and MHC-II receptors, which, in turn, result in more efficient interactions with T cells, thereby enhancing the germinal center (GC) reaction and antibody affinity maturation. Overall, BCR and TLR stimulation and the integration with signals from the pathogen or immune cells and their products, determine the ensuing B cell antibody response.},

EBF induced Pax5 and antagonized expression of genes encoding the transcription factors C/EBPalpha, PU.1 and Id2. Notably, sustained expression of EBF in Pax5-/- hematopoietic progenitor cells was sufficient to block their myeloid and T lineage potential in vivo.

By utilizing a tetracycline-regulated MYC transgene in a mouse T-ALL (EμSRα-tTA;tet-o-MYC) and human Burkitt’s lymphoma (P493-6) model, we demonstrated that DNMT1 and DNMT3B expression depend on high MYC levels, and that their transcription decreased upon MYC-inactivation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation indicated that MYC binds to the DNMT1 and DNMT3B promoters, implicating a direct transcriptional regulation. Hence, shRNA-mediated knock-down of endogenous MYC in human T-ALL and Burkitt’s lymphoma cell lines downregulated DNMT3B expression. Knock-down and pharmacologic inhibition of DNMT3B in T-ALL reduced cell proliferation associated with genome-wide changes in DNA methylation, indicating a tumor promoter function during tumor maintenance. We provide novel evidence that MYC directly deregulates the expression of both de novo and maintenance DNMTs, showing that MYC controls DNA methylation in a genome-wide fashion.

Hence, shRNA-mediated knock-down of endogenous MYC in human T-ALL and Burkitt’s lymphoma cell lines downregulated DNMT3B expression. Knock-down and pharmacologic inhibition of DNMT3B in T-ALL reduced cell proliferation associated with genome-wide changes in DNA methylation, indicating a tumor promoter function during tumor maintenance. We provide novel evidence that MYC directly deregulates the expression of both de novo and maintenance DNMTs, showing that MYC controls DNA methylation in a genome-wide fashion. Our finding that a coordinated interplay between the components of the DNA methylating machinery contributes to MYC-driven tumor maintenance highlights the potential of specific DNMTs for targeted therapies.},

  abstract = {B cells undergo affinity maturation and class switch recombination of their immunoglobulin receptors during a germinal center (GC) reaction, before they differentiate into long-lived antibody-secreting plasma cells (PCs). Transcription factors such as Bach2 and Mitf are essential during this process, as they delay premature differentiation of GC B cells by repressing Blimp-1 and IRF4, two transcription factors required for terminal PC differentiation. Therefore, Bach2 and Mitf expression must be attenuated in activated B cells to allow terminal PC differentiation, but the precise mechanism remains enigmatic. Here, we provide evidence that miR-148a, a small noncoding microRNA, fosters PC differentiation and survival. Next-generation sequencing revealed that miR-148a is the most abundant microRNA in primary human and murine PCs, and its expression is upregulated in activated murine B cells and coincides with Blimp-1 synthesis. miR-148a targets Bach2, Mitf and proapoptotic factors such as PTEN and Bim. When prematurely expressed, miR-148a promotes the differentiation and survival of plasmablasts and reduces frequencies of IgG1+ cells in primary B-cell cultures. In summary, we propose that miR-148a is a new player in the regulatory network controlling terminal PC differentiation and could, therefore, be a therapeutic target for interfering with PC differentiation and survival.},

  abstract = {Myc is one of the most commonly deregulated oncogenes in human cancer, yet therapies directly targeting Myc hyperactivation are not presently available in the clinic. The evolutionarily conserved function of Myc in modulating protein synthesis control is critical to the Myc oncogenic program. Indeed, enhancing the protein synthesis capacity of cancer cells directly contributes to their survival, proliferation, and genome instability. Therefore, inhibiting enhanced protein synthesis may represent a highly relevant strategy for the treatment of Myc-dependent human cancers. However, components of the translation machinery that can be exploited as therapeutic targets for Myc-driven cancers remain poorly defined. Here, we uncover a surprising and important functional link between Myc and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)-dependent phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E binding protein-1 (4EBP1), a master regulator of protein synthesis control. Using a pharmacogenetic approach, we find that mTOR-dependent phosphorylation of 4EBP1 is required for cancer cell survival in Myc-dependent tumor initiation and maintenance. We further show that a clinical mTOR active site inhibitor, which is capable of blocking mTOR-dependent 4EBP1 phosphorylation, has remarkable therapeutic efficacy in Myc-driven hematological cancers. Additionally, we demonstrate the clinical implications of these results by delineating a significant link between Myc and mTOR-dependent phosphorylation of 4EBP1 and therapeutic response in human lymphomas. Together, these findings reveal that an important mTOR substrate is found hyperactivated downstream of Myc oncogenic activity to promote tumor survival and confers synthetic lethality, thereby revealing a unique therapeutic approach to render Myc druggable in the clinic.},

In humans, three orthologs of the prototypical endonuclease VIII (Nei), the Nei-like NEIL1-3 enzymes are involved in the repair of oxidized DNA lesions. In recent years, several genome and cancer single-nucleotide polymorphic variants of the NEIL1 glycosylase have been identified. In this study we characterized four variants of human NEIL1: S82C, G83D, P208S, and ΔE28, and tested their ability to excise pyrimidine-derived lesions such as thymine glycol (Tg), 5-hydroxyuracil (5-OHU), and dihydrouracil (DHU) and the purine-derived guanidinohydantoin (Gh), spiroiminodihydantoin 1 (Sp1), and methylated 2,6-diamino-4-hydroxy-5-formamidopyrimidine (MeFapyG). The P208S variant has near wild-type activity on all substrates tested. The S82C and ΔE28 variants exhibit decreased Tg excision compared to wild-type. G83D displays little to no activity with any of the substrates tested, with the exception of Gh and Sp1. Human NEIL1 is known to undergo editing whereby the lysine at position 242 is recoded into an arginine. The non-edited form of NEIL1 is more efficient at cleaving Tg than the R242 form, but the G83D variant does not cleave Tg regardless of the edited status of NEIL1. The corresponding G86D variant in Mimivirus Nei1 similarly lacks glycosylase activity. A structure of a G86D–DNA complex reveals a rearrangement in the β4/5 loop comprising Leu84, the highly-conserved void-filling residue, thereby providing a structural rationale for the decreased glycosylase activity of the glycine to aspartate variant.},

These alterations have been shown to be accompanied by a loss of ability to recognize “self” and “foreign” antigens. Therefore the development of autoimmune responses like production of autoantibodies has been hypothesized to be secondary to thymus involution with a decline of naïve T cells and accumulation of clonal T cells with activation due to “neoantigens” during the aging process. Altered apoptosis and altered T cell homeostasis have been emphasized to promote a chronic inflammatory state and lead to the concept of a immune-risk phenotype. However, it has to be proven which kinds of mechanisms turn the immune system to manifest autoimmune disease and how speculated defects in T cell differentiation and interaction leading to premature aging of the immune system may contribute to the development of autoimmune diseases.},

In this study we have performed a global gene expression screen of wild-type and Pax5-deficient pro-B cells in an attempt to identify the crucial Pax5 targets in early B lymphopoiesis. These studies have identified 109 Pax5 targets comprising 61\% activated and 39\% repressed genes. Interestingly, Pax5 directly regulates the genes encoding a number of transcription factors that are required at the pre-B cell stage of differentiation, including Irf8, Spib, and Ikzf3 (Aiolos), suggesting that a key function of Pax5 is to activate secondary transcription factors that further reinforce the B cell program. Pax5 is also required for the expression of many genes known to be involved in adhesion and signaling, indicating that Pax5 modulates the homing and or migration properties of B cell progenitors. Finally, Pax5 also represses a cohort of genes that are involved in multiple biological processes, many of which are not typically associated with B cells. These include the repression of the adhesion molecule Embigin, which is expressed in bone marrow progenitors, T cells, and myeloid cells but is specifically repressed by Pax5 in B cells.},

  abstract = {Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) are two well defined entities that diverge in their basic pathogenic mechanisms and clinical evolution but they share epidemiological characteristics, cells of origin, molecular alterations, and clinical features that differ from other lymphoid neoplasms. CLL and MCL are classically considered indolent and aggressive neoplasms, respectively. However, the clinical evolution of both tumors is very heterogeneous, with subsets of patients having a stable disease for long time whereas others require immediate intervention. Both CLL and MCL include two major molecular subtypes that seem to derive from antigen experienced CD5+ B cells that retain a naïve or memory-like epigenetic signature and carry a variable load of IGHV somatic mutations from truly unmutated to highly mutated, respectively. These two subtypes of tumors differ in their molecular pathways, genomic alterations and clinical behavior, being more aggressive in naïve-like than memory-like derived tumors in both CLL and MCL. The pathogenesis of the two entities integrates the relevant influence of BCR signaling, tumor cell microenvironment interactions, genomic alterations and epigenome modifications that configure the evolution of the tumors and offer new possibilities for therapeutic intervention. This review will focus on the similarities and differences of these two tumors based on recent studies that are enhancing the understanding of their pathogenesis and creating solid bases for new management strategies.},

  abstract = {Bromodomain inhibition comprises a promising therapeutic strategy in cancer, particularly for hematologic malignancies. To date, however, genomic biomarkers to direct clinical translation have been lacking. We conducted a cell-based screen of genetically defined cancer cell lines using a prototypical inhibitor of BET bromodomains. Integration of genetic features with chemosensitivity data revealed a robust correlation between MYCN amplification and sensitivity to bromodomain inhibition. We characterized the mechanistic and translational significance of this finding in neuroblastoma, a childhood cancer with frequent amplification of MYCN. Genome-wide expression analysis showed downregulation of the MYCN transcriptional program accompanied by suppression of MYCN transcription. Functionally, bromodomain-mediated inhibition of MYCN impaired growth and induced apoptosis in neuroblastoma. BRD4 knockdown phenocopied these effects, establishing BET bromodomains as transcriptional regulators of MYCN. BET inhibition conferred a significant survival advantage in 3 in vivo neuroblastoma models, providing a compelling rationale for developing BET bromodomain inhibitors in patients with neuroblastoma. Significance: Biomarkers of response to small-molecule inhibitors of BET bromodomains, a new compound class with promising anticancer activity, have been lacking. Here, we reveal MYCN amplification as a strong genetic predictor of sensitivity to BET bromodomain inhibitors, show a mechanistic rationale for this finding, and provide a translational framework for clinical trial development of BET bromodomain inhibitors for pediatric patients with MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma.

  abstract = {Globally decreased histone 3, lysine 27 tri-methylation (H3K27me3) is a hallmark of H3K27-altered diffuse midline gliomas (DMGs) and group-A posterior fossa ependymomas (PFAs). H3K27-altered DMGs are largely characterized by lysine-to-methionine mutations in histone 3 at position 27 (H3K27M). Most PFAs overexpress EZH inhibitory protein (EZHIP), which possesses a region of similarity to the mutant H3K27M. Both H3K27M and EZHIP inhibit~the function of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) responsible for H3K27me3 deposition. These tumors often arise in neighboring regions of the brainstem and posterior fossa. In rare cases PFAs harbor H3K27M mutations, and DMGs overexpress EZHIP. These findings together raise the possibility that certain cell populations in the developing hindbrain/posterior fossa are especially sensitive to modulation of H3K27me3 states. We identified shared molecular features by comparing genomic, bulk transcriptomic, chromatin-based profiles, and single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from the two tumor classes. Our approach demonstrated that 1q gain, a key biomarker in PFAs, is prognostic in H3.1K27M, but not H3.3K27M gliomas. Conversely, Activin A Receptor Type 1 (ACVR1), which is associated with mutations in H3.1K27M gliomas, is overexpressed in a subset of PFAs with poor outcome. Despite diffuse H3K27me3 reduction, previous work shows that both tumors maintain genomic H3K27me3 deposition at select sites. We demonstrate heterogeneity in shared patterns of residual H3K27me3 for both tumors that largely segregated with inferred anatomic tumor origins and progenitor populations of tumor cells. In contrast, analysis of genes linked to H3K27 acetylation (H3K27ac)-marked enhancers showed higher expression in astrocytic-like tumor cells. Finally, common H3K27me3-marked genes mapped closely to expression patterns in the human developing hindbrain. Overall, our data demonstrate developmentally relevant molecular similarities between PFAs and H3K27M DMGs and support the overall hypothesis that deregulated mechanisms of hindbrain development are central to the biology of both tumors.},

  abstract = {Polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR) is a key component of the mucosal immune system that mediates epithelial transcytosis of immunoglobulins. The expression of pIgR was reported to be up-regulated and related to the prognosis of several human cancers. However, the clinical significance of pIgR in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to detect the pIgR expression and its prognostic value in NPC. The expression of serum pIgR was measured in NPC patients and healthy controls by real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and western blotting analyses. The relationship between its expression and clinical factors was analyzed by chi-square test. Then, the overall survival of patients was assessed by Kaplan-Meier analysis while the prognostic value of serum pIgR was estimated using univariate and multivariate analyses with cox regression analysis. Serum pIgR was down-regulated in NPC patients compared to that in healthy controls both at messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein levels. Especially, its expression was also significantly lower in patients at advantage stages (III–IV) than those at early stages (I–II). And, the low pIgR expression was strongly associated with advanced clinical stages, T stage, N stage, and distant metastasis. Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated that patients with low pIgR expression had a significantly shorter overall survival than those with high expression at any stages. Cox regression analysis suggested that pIgR was closely related to the prognosis of NPC. Serum pIgR expression was reduced in NPC, and it could be an independent prognostic predictor for patients with this cancer.},

  abstract = {Summary Here, we define the landscape and dynamics of active regulatory DNA in cutaneous T~cell lymphoma (CTCL) by ATAC-seq. Analysis of 111 human CTCL and control samples revealed extensive chromatin signatures that distinguished leukemic, host, and normal CD4+ T~cells. We identify three dominant patterns of transcription factor (TF) activation that drive leukemia regulomes, as well as TF deactivations that alter host T~cells in CTCL patients. Clinical response to histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) is strongly associated with a concurrent gain in chromatin accessibility. HDACi causes distinct chromatin responses in leukemic and host CD4+ T~cells, reprogramming host T~cells toward normalcy. These results provide a foundational framework to study personal regulomes in human cancer and epigenetic therapy.},

  abstract = {Prospective identification of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) destined to progress would greatly facilitate their clinical management. Recently, whole-genome DNA methylation analyses identified three clinicobiologic CLL subgroups with an epigenetic signature related to different normal B-cell counterparts. Here, we developed a clinically applicable method to identify these subgroups and to study their clinical relevance. Using a support vector machine approach, we built a prediction model using five epigenetic biomarkers that was able to classify CLL patients accurately into the three subgroups, namely naive B-cell-like, intermediate and memory B-cell-like CLL. DNA methylation was quantified by highly reproducible bisulfite pyrosequencing assays in two independent CLL series. In the initial series (n=211), the three subgroups showed differential levels of IGHV (immunoglobulin heavy-chain locus) mutation (P{$<$}0.001) and VH usage (P{$<$}0.03), as well as different clinical features and outcome in terms of time to first treatment (TTT) and overall survival (P{$<$}0.001). A multivariate Cox model showed that epigenetic classification was the strongest predictor of TTT (P{$<$}0.001) along with Binet stage (P{$<$}0.001). These findings were corroborated in a validation series (n=97). In this study, we developed a simple and robust method using epigenetic biomarkers to categorize CLLs into three subgroups with different clinicobiologic features and outcome.},

An integrative epigenomic approach revealed 10,504 differentially methylated regions in regulatory elements marked by H3K27ac in MCL primary cases, including a distant enhancer showing de~novo looping to the MCL oncogene SOX11. Finally, we observed that the magnitude of DNA methylation changes per case is highly variable and serves as an independent prognostic factor for MCL outcome.},

  abstract = {Motivation: Testing for correlations between different sets of genomic features is a fundamental task in genomics research. However, searching for overlaps between features with existing web-based methods is complicated by the massive datasets that are routinely produced with current sequencing technologies. Fast and flexible tools are therefore required to ask complex questions of these data in an efficient manner. Results: This article introduces a new software suite for the comparison, manipulation and annotation of genomic features in Browser Extensible Data (BED) and General Feature Format (GFF) format. BEDTools also supports the comparison of sequence alignments in BAM format to both BED and GFF features. The tools are extremely efficient and allow the user to compare large datasets (e.g. next-generation sequencing data) with both public and custom genome annotation tracks. BEDTools can be combined with one another as well as with standard UNIX commands, thus facilitating routine genomics tasks as well as pipelines that can quickly answer intricate questions of large genomic datasets. Availability and implementation: BEDTools was written in C++.

  abstract = {Cell-fate transitions involve the integration of genomic information encoded by regulatory elements, such as enhancers, with the cellular environment. However, identification of genomic sequences that control human embryonic development represents a formidable challenge. Here we show that in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), unique chromatin signatures identify two distinct classes of genomic elements, both of which are marked by the presence of chromatin regulators p300 and BRG1, monomethylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4me1), and low nucleosomal density. In addition, elements of the first class are distinguished by the acetylation of histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27ac), overlap with previously characterized hESC enhancers, and are located proximally to genes expressed in hESCs and the epiblast. In contrast, elements of the second class, which we term ‘poised enhancers’, are distinguished by the absence of H3K27ac, enrichment of histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3), and are linked to genes inactive in hESCs and instead are involved in orchestrating early steps in embryogenesis, such as gastrulation, mesoderm formation and neurulation. Consistent with the poised identity, during differentiation of hESCs to neuroepithelium, a neuroectoderm-specific subset of poised enhancers acquires a chromatin signature associated with active enhancers. When assayed in zebrafish embryos, poised enhancers are able to direct cell-type and stage-specific expression characteristic of their proximal developmental gene, even in the absence of sequence conservation in the fish genome. Our data demonstrate that early developmental enhancers are epigenetically pre-marked in hESCs and indicate an unappreciated role of H3K27me3 at distal regulatory elements. Moreover, the wealth of new regulatory sequences identified here provides an invaluable resource for studies and isolation of transient, rare cell populations representing early stages of human embryogenesis.},

We identify proximal and distal regulatory elements necessary for expression of four embryonic stem cell–specific genes. We show a consistent contribution of neighboring gene promoters to gene expression and identify unmarked regulatory elements (UREs) that control gene expression but do not have typical enhancer epigenetic or chromatin features.

Alternatively, the Mi-2β ATPase subunit of Mi-2/NuRD can promote transcription. Together, these gatekeeper functions of Mi-2/NuRD influence cell fate decisions by modulating transcriptional activity. Recent studies have shown the importance of Mi-2/NuRD both in maintaining hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) pools and in normal lineage progression. Furthermore, components of Mi-2/NuRD complexes have been linked directly to oncogenesis and have potential as therapeutic targets for cancer treatment. Mi-2/NuRD’s essential functions in metazoan cell fates and activities underscore its importance as a focal point of epigenetic research.},

Recent studies in several different systems suggest that not only may the rate of aging be modified by environmental and genetic factors, but also that the aging clock can be reversed, restoring characteristics of youthfulness to aged cells and tissues. This Review focuses on the emerging biology of rejuvenation through the lens of epigenetic reprogramming. By defining youthfulness and senescence as epigenetic states, a framework for asking new questions about the aging process emerges.},

  abstract = {Long noncoding RNAs are emerging as important regulators of cellular functions, but little is known of their role in the human immune system. Here we investigated long intergenic noncoding RNAs (lincRNAs) in 13 subsets of T lymphocytes and B lymphocytes by next-generation sequencing-based RNA sequencing (RNA-seq analysis) and de novo transcriptome reconstruction. We identified over 500 previously unknown lincRNAs and described lincRNA signatures. Expression of linc-MAF-4, a chromatin-associated lincRNA specific to the TH1 subset of helper T cells, was inversely correlated with expression of MAF, a TH2-associated transcription factor. Downregulation of linc-MAF-4 skewed T cell differentiation toward the TH2 phenotype. We identified a long-distance interaction between the genomic regions of the gene encoding linc-MAF-4 and MAF, where linc-MAF-4 associated with the chromatin modifiers LSD1 and EZH2; this suggested that linc-MAF-4 regulated MAF transcription through the recruitment of chromatin modifiers. Our results demonstrate a key role for lincRNA in T lymphocyte differentiation.},

The densest, in human lymphoblastoid cells, contains 4.9 billion contacts, achieving 1 kb resolution. We find that genomes are partitioned into contact domains (median length, 185 kb), which are associated with distinct patterns of histone marks and segregate into six subcompartments. We identify ∼10,000 loops. These loops frequently link promoters and enhancers, correlate with gene activation, and show conservation across cell types and species. Loop anchors typically occur at domain boundaries and bind CTCF. CTCF sites at loop anchors occur predominantly (\&gt;90\%) in a convergent orientation, with the asymmetric motifs “facing” one another. The inactive X chromosome splits into two massive domains and contains large loops anchored at CTCF-binding repeats. PaperFlick},

Here, we perform scRNAseq in six PAs using methods that enabled detection of the rearrangement. When compared to higher-grade gliomas, a strikingly higher proportion of the PA cancer cells exhibit a differentiated, astrocyte-like phenotype. A smaller proportion of cells exhibit a progenitor-like phenotype with evidence of proliferation. These express a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) programme that was absent from higher-grade gliomas. Immune cells, especially microglia, comprise 40\% of all cells in the PAs and account for differences in bulk expression profiles between tumor locations and subtypes. These data indicate that MAPK signaling is restricted to relatively undifferentiated cancer cells in PA, with implications for investigational therapies directed at this pathway.},

  abstract = {For differentiation-defective malignancies, compounds that modulate transcription, such as retinoic acid and histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, are of particular interest. HDAC inhibitors are currently under investigation for the treatment of a broad spectrum of cancer diseases. However, one clinical drawback is class-specific toxicity of unselective inhibitors, limiting their full anticancer potential. Selective targeting of individual HDAC isozymes in defined tumor entities may therefore be an attractive alternative treatment approach. We have previously identified HDAC family member 8 (HDAC8) as a novel target in childhood neuroblastoma. Using small-molecule inhibitors, we now demonstrate that selective inhibition of HDAC8 exhibits antineuroblastoma activity without toxicity in two xenograft mouse models of MYCN oncogene-amplified neuroblastoma. In contrast, the unselective HDAC inhibitor vorinostat was more toxic in the same models. HDAC8-selective inhibition induced cell cycle arrest and differentiation in vitro and in vivo. Upon combination with retinoic acid, differentiation was significantly enhanced, as demonstrated by elongated neurofilament-positive neurites and upregulation of NTRK1. Additionally, MYCN oncogene expression was downregulated in vitro and tumor cell growth was markedly reduced in vivo. Mechanistic studies suggest that cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) links HDAC8- and retinoic acid-mediated gene transcription. In conclusion, HDAC-selective targeting can be effective in tumors exhibiting HDAC isozyme-dependent tumor growth in vivo and can be combined with differentiation-inducing agents.},

Finally, we discuss novel approaches to modulate the antibody, the tumor cell, and the host immunologic environment to overcome rituximab resistance.

While these often occur co-transcriptionally between nascent RNA and template DNA, we now show that they also form as part of a post-transcriptional mechanism targeting AID to IgH S-regions. This depends on the RNA helicase DDX1 that is also required for CSR in~vivo. DDX1 binds to G-quadruplex (G4) structures present in intronic switch transcripts and converts them into S-region R-loops.~This in turn targets the cytidine deaminase enzyme AID to S-regions so promoting CSR. Notably R-loop levels over S-regions are diminished by chemical stabilization of G4 RNA or by the expression of a DDX1 ATPase-deficient mutant that acts as a dominant-negative protein to reduce CSR efficiency. In effect, we provide evidence for how S-region transcripts interconvert between G4 and R-loop structures to promote CSR in the IgH locus.},

  abstract = {Interactions between environmental and genetic factors are proposed to explain why autoimmunity afflicts certain individuals and not others. Genes and genetic loci predisposing to autoimmunity are being identified, but theories as to how the environment contributes to autoimmunity still rely largely on examples such as drug-induced systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and epidemiologic evidence of occupational exposure, without clear mechanistic explanations or identification of specific environmental agents. Eukaryotic gene expression requires not only transcription factor activation but also regional modification of chromatin structure into a transcriptionally permissive configuration through epigenetic mechanisms, including DNA methylation and histone modifications. The realization that epigenetic mechanisms can alter gene expression and, therefore, cellular function has led to new insights into how environmental agents might contribute to the development of diseases in genetically predisposed individuals. The observation that some SLE-inducing drugs, such as procainamide and hydralazine, affect T cell DNA methylation and thereby cellular function, and that identical changes in T cell DNA methylation and cellular function are found in patients with SLE, implicates epigenetic mechanisms in the pathogenesis of human SLE, and perhaps other autoimmune diseases. In this Review we discuss how epigenetic mechanisms affect gene expression, how environmental agents can affect epigenetic mechanisms, and how epigenetic changes in gene expression can contribute to autoimmunity. Similar mechanisms might also contribute to the pathogenesis of other poorly understood human diseases.},

  abstract = {Pattern recognition is concerned with the development of systems that learn to solve a given problem using a set of example instances, each represented by a number of features. These problems include clustering, the grouping of similar instances; classification, the task of assigning a discrete label to a given instance; and dimensionality reduction, combining or selecting features to arrive at a more useful representation. The use of statistical pattern recognition algorithms in bioinformatics is pervasive. Classification and clustering are often applied to high-throughput measurement data arising from microarray, mass spectrometry and next-generation sequencing experiments for selecting markers, predicting phenotype and grouping objects or genes. Less explicitly, classification is at the core of a wide range of tools such as predictors of genes, protein function, functional or genetic interactions, etc., and used extensively in systems biology. A course on pattern recognition (or machine learning) should therefore be at the core of any bioinformatics education program. In this review, we discuss the main elements of a pattern recognition course, based on material developed for courses taught at the BSc, MSc and PhD levels to an audience of bioinformaticians, computer scientists and life scientists. We pay attention to common problems and pitfalls encountered in applications and in interpretation of the results obtained.},

A key feature of the model is the proposal of sequence-specific DNA methylases that methylate unmethylated sites with great difficulty but easily methylate half-methylated sites. Although such enzymes have not yet been detected in eukaryotes, they are known in bacteria. An argument is presented, based on recent data on DNA-binding proteins, that DNA methylation should affect the binding of regulatory proteins. In support of the model, short reviews are included covering both mammalian X inactivation and bacterial restriction and modification enzymes.},

Here we characterize the transcriptional landscape of the four human HOX loci at five base pair resolution in 11 anatomic sites and identify 231 HOX ncRNAs that extend known transcribed regions by more than 30 kilobases. HOX ncRNAs are spatially expressed along developmental axes and possess unique sequence motifs, and their expression demarcates broad chromosomal domains of differential histone methylation and RNA polymerase accessibility. We identified a 2.2 kilobase ncRNA residing in the HOXC locus, termed HOTAIR, which represses transcription in trans across 40 kilobases of the HOXD locus. HOTAIR interacts with Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) and is required for PRC2 occupancy and histone H3 lysine-27 trimethylation of HOXD locus. Thus, transcription of ncRNA may demarcate chromosomal domains of gene silencing at a distance; these results have broad implications for gene regulation in development and disease states.},

However, this secondary structure of chromatin remains poorly understood compared with the primary structure of single nucleosomes or the tertiary structure of long-range looping interactions. Here we report the first genome-wide map of chromatin conformation in human cells at the 1–3 nucleosome (50–500 bp) scale, obtained using ionizing radiation-induced spatially correlated cleavage of DNA with sequencing (RICC-seq) to identify DNA–DNA contacts that are spatially proximal. Unbiased analysis of RICC-seq signal reveals regional enrichment of DNA fragments characteristic of alternating rather than adjacent nucleosome interactions in tri-nucleosome units, particularly in H3K9me3-marked heterochromatin. We infer differences in the likelihood of nucleosome–nucleosome contacts among open chromatin, H3K27me3-marked, and H3K9me3-marked repressed chromatin regions. After calibrating RICC-seq signal to three-dimensional distances, we show that compact two-start helical fibre structures with stacked alternating nucleosomes are consistent with RICC-seq fragmentation patterns from H3K9me3-marked chromatin, while non-compact structures and solenoid structures are consistent with open chromatin. Our data support a model of chromatin architecture in intact interphase nuclei consistent with variable longitudinal compaction of two-start helical fibres.},

  abstract = {The fundamental role of altered epigenetic modification patterns in tumorigenesis establishes epigenetic regulatory enzymes as important targets for cancer therapy. Over the past few years, several drugs with an epigenetic activity have received approval for the treatment of cancer patients, which has led to a detailed characterization of their modes of action. The results showed that both established drug classes, the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors and the DNA methyltransferase inhibitors, show substantial limitations in their epigenetic specificity. HDAC inhibitors are highly specific drugs, but the enzymes have a broad substrate specificity and deacetylate numerous proteins that are not associated with epigenetic regulation. Similarly, the induction of global DNA demethylation by non-specific inhibition of DNA methyltransferases shows pleiotropic effects on epigenetic regulation with no apparent tumor-specificity. Second-generation azanucleoside drugs have integrated the knowledge about the cellular uptake and metabolization pathways, but do not show any increased specificity for cancer epigenotypes. As such, the traditional rationale of epigenetic cancer therapy appears to be in need of refinement, as we move from the global inhibition of epigenetic modifications toward the identification and targeting of tumor-specific epigenetic programs. Recent studies have identified epigenetic mechanisms that promote self-renewal and developmental plasticity in cancer cells. Druggable somatic mutations in the corresponding epigenetic regulators are beginning to be identified and should facilitate the development of epigenetic therapy approaches with improved tumor specificity.},

Unfortunately, children in LMICs experience far worse outcomes with 5-year survival rates as low as 20\%. To address inequities in the treatment of childhood cancer and disease burden globally, the World Health Organization (WHO) launched the Global Initiative for Childhood Cancer. Within this initiative, pediatric low-grade glioma (LGG) represents a unique opportunity for the neurosurgical community to directly contribute to a paradigm shift in the survival outcomes of children in LMICs, as many of these tumors can be managed with surgical resection alone. In this chapter, we discuss the burden of pediatric LGG and outline actions the neurosurgical community might consider to improve survival for children with LGG in LMICs.},

  abstract = {Great progress has recently been achieved in the understanding of the genomic alterations driving chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Nevertheless, the specific molecular mechanisms governing chromatin remodeling in CLL are unknown. Here we report the genetic and functional characterization of somatic mutations affecting the chromatin remodeler CHD2, one of the most frequently mutated genes in CLL (5.3\%) and in monoclonal B lymphocytosis (MBL, 7\%), a B-cell expansion that can evolve to CLL. Most of the mutations affecting CHD2, identified by whole-exome sequencing of 456 CLL and 43 MBL patients, are either truncating or affect conserved residues in functional domains, thus supporting a putative role for CHD2 as a tumor suppressor gene. CHD2 mutants show altered nuclear distribution, and a chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein 2 (CHD2) mutant affected in its DNA-binding domain exhibits defective association with active chromatin. Clinicobiological analyses show that most CLL patients carrying CHD2 mutations also present mutated immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region genes (IGHVs), being the most frequently mutated gene in this prognostic subgroup. This is the first study providing functional evidence supporting CHD2 as a cancer driver and opens the way to further studies of the role of this chromatin remodeler in CLL.},

Transcriptome analysis of bic/microRNA-155–deficient CD4+ T cells identified a wide spectrum of microRNA-155–regulated genes, including cytokines, chemokines, and transcription factors. Our work suggests that bic/microRNA-155 plays a key role in the homeostasis and function of the immune system. Deletion of a microRNA sequence in mice impairs their immunity, causing abnormal immune responses and cytokine production, as well as gut and lung inflammation.

We analyzed sequence context specificity of mutations in the B cells from a large cohort of FL patients. We revealed substantial excess of mutations within a novel hybrid nucleotide motif: the signature of somatic hypermutation (SHM) enzyme, Activation Induced Deaminase (AID), which overlaps the CpG methylation site. This finding implies that in FL the SHM machinery acts at genomic sites containing methylated cytosine. We identified the prevalence of this hybrid mutational signature in many other types of human cancer, suggesting that AID-mediated, CpG-methylation dependent mutagenesis is a common feature of tumorigenesis.},

  abstract = {Most oncology compounds entering clinical development have passed stringent preclinical pharmacology evaluation criteria. However, only a small fraction of experimental agents induce meaningful antitumor activities in the clinic. Low predictability of conventional preclinical pharmacology models is frequently cited as a main reason for the unusually high clinical attrition rates of therapeutic compounds in oncology. Therefore, improvement in the predictive values of preclinical efficacy models for clinical outcome holds great promise to reduce the clinical attrition rates of experimental compounds. Recent reports suggest that pharmacology studies conducted with patient derived xenograft (PDX) tumors are more predictive for clinical outcome compared to conventional, cell line derived xenograft (CDX) models, in particular when therapeutic compounds were tested at clinically relevant doses (CRDs). Moreover, the study of the most malignant cell types within tumors, the tumor initiating cells (TICs), relies on the availability of preclinical models that mimic the lineage hierarchy of cells within tumors. PDX models were shown to more closely recapitulate the heterogeneity of patient tumors and maintain the molecular, genetic, and histological complexity of human tumors during early stages of sequential passaging in mice, rendering them ideal tools to study the responses of TICs, tumor- and stromal cells to therapeutic intervention. In this commentary, we review the progress made in the development of PDX models in key areas of oncology research, including target identification and validation, tumor indication search and the development of a biomarker hypothesis that can be tested in the clinic to identify patients that will benefit most from therapeutic intervention.},

We now map genome-wide ER binding events, by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq), in primary breast cancers from patients with different clinical outcome and in distant ER positive (ER+) metastases. We find that drug resistant cancers still have ER-chromatin occupancy, but that ER binding is a dynamic process, with the acquisition of unique ER binding regions in tumours from patients that are likely to relapse. The acquired, poor outcome ER regulatory regions observed in primary tumours reveal gene signatures that predict clinical outcome in ER+ disease exclusively. We find that the differential ER binding programme observed in tumours from patients with poor outcome is not due to the selection of a rare subpopulation of cells, but is due to the FoxA1-mediated reprogramming of ER binding on a rapid time scale. The parallel redistribution of ER and FoxA1 cis-regulatory elements in drug resistant cellular contexts is supported by histological co-expression of ER and FoxA1 in metastatic samples. By establishing transcription factor mapping in primary tumour material, we show that there is plasticity in ER binding capacity, with distinct combinations of cis-regulatory elements linked with the different clinical outcomes.},

The data from each single cell are sparse, comprising on the order of 1,000 unique reads. However, by assaying thousands of ES cells, we identify a spectrum of subpopulations defined by differences in chromatin signatures of pluripotency and differentiation priming. We corroborate these findings by comparison to orthogonal single-cell gene expression data.

  abstract = {Purpose: Cutaneous T-cell lymphomas (CTCL) are a heterogeneous group of malignancies that despite available therapies commonly relapse. The emergence of combination epigenetic therapies in other hematologic malignancies have made investigation of such combinations in CTCL a priority. Here, we explore the synergistic antiproliferative effects of romidepsin, an HDAC inhibitor, and azacitidine, a demethylating agent, combination in CTCL. Experimental Design: The growth inhibition under combination treatment and single agent was explored by the MTT cell viability assay and the Annexin V/propidium iodide (PI) apoptosis assay in different CTCL cell lines and tumor cells derived from Sézary syndrome patients. Quantitative analysis of a dose–effect relationship of romidepsin and azacitidine was done by the CompuSyn software. Investigation of mechanism of action was performed by flow cytometry, immunoblotting, qRT-PCR arrays, and chromatin immunoprecipitation. Global CpG methylation sequencing was utilized to study genome methylation alteration under the treatment modalities. Results: The combination of romidepsin and azacitidine exerts synergistic antiproliferative effects and induction of apoptosis involving activation of the caspase cascade in CTCL cell lines and tumor cells derived from Sézary syndrome patients. We identified genes that were selectively induced by the combination treatment, such as the tumor suppressor gene RhoB that is linked to enhanced histone acetylation at its promoter region in parallel with pronounced expression of p21. Global CpG methylation sequencing in a CTCL cell line and tumor cells demonstrated a subset of genes with a unique change in methylation profile in the combination treatment. Conclusions: The synergistic antiproliferative effects of romidepsin and azacitidine combination treatment justify further exploration in clinical trials for advanced CTCL.

Although its role in chromatid cohesion is well established, the functional significance of cohesin's association with interphase chromatin is not clear. Using a quantitative proteomics approach, we show that the STAG1 (Scc3/SA1) subunit of cohesin interacts with the CCTC-binding factor CTCF bound to the c-myc insulator element. Both allele-specific binding of CTCF and Scc3/SA1 at the imprinted IGF2/H19 gene locus and our analyses of human DM1 alleles containing base substitutions at CTCF-binding motifs indicate that cohesin recruitment to chromosomal sites depends on the presence of CTCF. A large-scale genomic survey using ChIP-Chip demonstrates that Scc3/SA1 binding strongly correlates with the CTCF-binding site distribution in chromosomal arms. However, some chromosomal sites interact exclusively with CTCF, whereas others interact with Scc3/SA1 only. Furthermore, immunofluorescence microscopy and ChIP-Chip experiments demonstrate that CTCF associates with both centromeres and chromosomal arms during metaphase. These results link cohesin to gene regulatory functions and suggest an essential role for CTCF during sister chromatid cohesion. These results have implications for the functional role of cohesin subunits in the pathogenesis of Cornelia de Lange syndrome and Roberts syndromes.},

  abstract = {Interleukin 4 (IL-4), an essential mediator of B cell development, plays a role in survival of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells. To obtain new insights into the function of the IL-4 pathway in CLL, we analyzed the gene expression response to IL-4 in CLL and in normal B cells (NBC) by oligonucleotide microarrays, resulting in the identification of 232 non-redundant entities in CLL and 146 in NBC (95 common, 283 altogether), of which 189 were well-defined genes in CLL and 123 in NBC (83 common, 229 altogether) (p{$<$}0.05, 2-fold cut-off). To the best of our knowledge, most of them were novel IL-4 targets for CLL (98\%), B cells of any source (83\%), or any cell type (70\%). Responses were significantly higher for 54 and 11 genes in CLL and NBC compared to each other, respectively. In CLL, ZAP-70 status had an impact on IL-4 response, since different sets of IL-4 targets correlated positively or negatively with baseline expression of ZAP-70. In addition, the NFκB inhibitor 6-Amino-4-(4-phenoxyphenethylamino)quinazoline, which reversed the anti-apoptotic effect of IL-4, preferentially blocked the response of genes positively correlated with ZAP-70 (e.g. CCR2, SUSD2), but enhanced the response of genes negatively correlated with ZAP-70 (e.g. AUH, BCL6, LY75, NFIL3). Dissection of the gene expression response to IL-4 in CLL and NBC contributes to the understanding of the anti-apoptotic response. Initial evidence of a connection between ZAP-70 and NFκB supports further exploration of targeting NFκB in the context of the assessment of inhibition of the IL-4 pathway as a therapeutic strategy in CLL, especially in patients expressing bad prognostic markers.},

  abstract = {Interleukin 4 (IL-4), an essential mediator of B cell development, plays a role in survival of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells. To obtain new insights into the function of the IL-4 pathway in CLL, we analyzed the gene expression response to IL-4 in CLL and in normal B cells (NBC) by oligonucleotide microarrays, resulting in the identification of 232 non-redundant entities in CLL and 146 in NBC (95 common, 283 altogether), of which 189 were well-defined genes in CLL and 123 in NBC (83 common, 229 altogether) (p{$<$}0.05, 2-fold cut-off). To the best of our knowledge, most of them were novel IL-4 targets for CLL (98\%), B cells of any source (83\%), or any cell type (70\%). Responses were significantly higher for 54 and 11 genes in CLL and NBC compared to each other, respectively. In CLL, ZAP-70 status had an impact on IL-4 response, since different sets of IL-4 targets correlated positively or negatively with baseline expression of ZAP-70. In addition, the NFκB inhibitor 6-Amino-4-(4-phenoxyphenethylamino)quinazoline, which reversed the anti-apoptotic effect of IL-4, preferentially blocked the response of genes positively correlated with ZAP-70 (e.g. CCR2, SUSD2), but enhanced the response of genes negatively correlated with ZAP-70 (e.g. AUH, BCL6, LY75, NFIL3). Dissection of the gene expression response to IL-4 in CLL and NBC contributes to the understanding of the anti-apoptotic response. Initial evidence of a connection between ZAP-70 and NFκB supports further exploration of targeting NFκB in the context of the assessment of inhibition of the IL-4 pathway as a therapeutic strategy in CLL, especially in patients expressing bad prognostic markers.},

We performed integrative analysis of Notch-regulated transcripts, genomic binding of Notch transcription complexes, and genome conformation data to identify direct Notch target genes in MCL cell lines. This B~cell Notch regulome is largely controlled through Notch-bound distal enhancers and includes genes involved in B cell receptor and cytokine signaling and the oncogene MYC, which sustains proliferation of Notch-dependent MCL cell lines via a Notch-regulated lineage-restricted enhancer complex. Expression of direct Notch target genes is associated with Notch activity in an MCL xenograft model and in CLL lymph node biopsies. Our findings provide key insights into the role of Notch in MCL and other B~cell malignancies and have important implications for therapeutic targeting of Notch-dependent oncogenic pathways.},

  abstract = {Gain-of-function mutations in Notch receptor genes occur in 10-15\% of cases of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), and are associated with inferior clinical outcomes. Nearly all Notch mutations reported in B cell tumors lead to loss of the C-terminal negative regulatory PEST domain and result in stabilization of the activated form of Notch (intracellular Notch [ICN]), whereas mutations that lead to ligand-independent Notch activation (which are common in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia [T-ALL]) are rare. ICN can be detected in tumor cells within lymph nodes of {$>$}80\% of patients with CLL, suggesting that Notch may have a broader oncogenic role than the incidence of Notch mutations would suggest. However, the downstream targets of Notch in B-cell tumors have not been identified. We used a gamma-secretase inhibitor (GSI) washout strategy to determine the immediate, direct effects of Notch activation in three MCL cell lines with Notch gain-of-function mutations, including two cell lines with unusual Notch gene rearrangements that lead to ligand-independent Notch activation, as well as a third line with a Notch PEST domain mutation in which signaling was activated with recombinant Notch ligand. Using these models, we identified likely direct target genes and their associated genomic Notch response elements using RNA-seq and ChIP-Seq in the Notch-on and Notch-off states. Most of these response elements corresponded to long-range enhancers that showed Notch-dependent changes in H3K27 acetylation, and were bound by components of the Notch transcription complex (NTC) in both cell lines. We confirmed these associations by performing ChIP-Seq on primary CLL and MCL biopsies, and by identifying specific looping interactions with Notch target gene promoters in public genome-wide proximity ligation datasets (RNA Pol2 ChIA-PET) from a lymphoblastoid cell line expressing the EBV-encoded Notch surrogate protein EBNA2. MYC was among the most strongly Notch-activated genes in Notch-dependent MCL cell lines and was associated with NTC binding at two B cell-specific 5' enhancers distinct from the Notch-dependent MYC enhancer previously identified in T-ALL. MCL cell line proliferation was blocked by Cas9 nuclease or epigenetic repressors targeting the 5' MYC enhancers, whereas cells were rescued from Notch inhibition by GSI via transduction with MYC. Gene set enrichment analysis of other direct Notch target genes identified in MCL models showed enrichment for regulators of B cell receptor (BCR) signaling, including the Src family kinase genes FYN, LYN, and BLK, and the signaling complex adaptor BLNK, as well as regulators of CD40 and cytokine signaling. RNA-seq analysis of primary CLL lymph node biopsies revealed significantly higher expression of many Notch target genes in biopsies with high levels of ICN. To functionally validate Notch target genes in primary tumors, we co-cultured CLL and MCL cells obtained from peripheral blood with Notch ligand-expressing stromal cells in the presence ("notch off") or absence ("notch on") of GSI, and demonstrated increased expression of Notch target genes, including MYC, in the "notch-on" cells. Furthermore, "notch-on" CLL cells showed increased phosphorylation of the BCR signaling intermediates SYK and PLCg2 upon BCR crosslinking compared to GSI-treated cells. Finally, we validated Notch-dependent regulation of target genes in vivo in a patient-derived xenograft model of NOTCH1-mutant MCL. Notch target gene expression was significantly higher in MCL cells within the spleen versus bone marrow or blood, but was markedly reduced in animals treated for five days with GSI. Additional xenograft studies are ongoing, and will be described at the meeting. Our data link active Notch signaling to two well-characterized oncogenic drivers in B cell lymphoma, MYC and BCR signaling, and may have important implications for the development of treatment strategies involving Notch antagonists and other targeted therapeutics, such as BCR targeting agents.

  abstract = {Somatic mutations are the driving force of cancer genome evolution. The rate of somatic mutations appears to be greatly variable across the genome due to variations in chromatin organization, DNA accessibility and replication timing. However, other variables that may influence the mutation rate locally are unknown, such as a role for DNA-binding proteins, for example. Here we demonstrate that the rate of somatic mutations in melanomas is highly increased at active transcription factor binding sites and nucleosome embedded DNA, compared to their flanking regions. Using recently available excision-repair sequencing (XR-seq) data, we show that the higher mutation rate at these sites is caused by a decrease of the levels of nucleotide excision repair (NER) activity. Our work demonstrates that DNA-bound proteins interfere with the NER machinery, which results in an increased rate of DNA mutations at the protein binding sites. This finding has important implications for our understanding of mutational and DNA repair processes and in the identification of cancer driver mutations.},

  abstract = {The c-myc proto-oncogene product, Myc, is a transcription factor that binds thousands of genomic loci1. Recent work suggested that rather than up- and downregulating selected groups of genes1,2,3, Myc targets all active promoters and enhancers in the genome (a phenomenon termed ‘invasion’) and acts as a general amplifier of transcription4,5. However, the available data did not readily discriminate between direct and indirect effects of Myc on RNA biogenesis. We addressed this issue with genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation and RNA expression profiles during B-cell lymphomagenesis in mice, in cultured B cells and fibroblasts. Consistent with long-standing observations6, we detected general increases in total RNA or messenger RNA copies per cell (hereby termed ‘amplification’)4,5 when comparing actively proliferating cells with control quiescent cells: this was true whether cells were stimulated by mitogens (requiring endogenous Myc for a proliferative response)7,8 or by deregulated, oncogenic Myc activity. RNA amplification and promoter/enhancer invasion by Myc were separable phenomena that could occur without one another. Moreover, whether or not associated with RNA amplification, Myc drove the differential expression of distinct subsets of target genes. Hence, although having the potential to interact with all active or poised regulatory elements in the genome4,5,9,10,11, Myc does not directly act as a global transcriptional amplifier4,5. Instead, our results indicate that Myc activates and represses transcription of discrete gene sets, leading to changes in cellular state that can in turn feed back on global RNA production and turnover.},

  abstract = {B-cell maturation and germinal center (GC) formation are dependent on the interplay between BCL6 and other transcriptional regulators. FOXP1 is a transcription factor that regulates early B-cell development, but whether it plays a role in mature B cells is unknown. Analysis of human tonsillar B-cell subpopulations revealed that FOXP1 shows the opposite expression pattern to BCL6, suggesting that FOXP1 regulates the transition from resting follicular B cell to activated GC B cell. Chromatin immunoprecipitation-on-chip and gene expression assays on B cells indicated that FOXP1 acts as a transcriptional activator and repressor of genes involved in the GC reaction, half of which are also BCL6 targets. To study FOXP1 function in vivo, we developed transgenic mice expressing human FOXP1 in lymphoid cells. These mice exhibited irregular formation of splenic GCs, showing a modest increase in naïve and marginal-zone B cells and a significant decrease in GC B cells. Furthermore, aberrant expression of FOXP1 impaired transcription of noncoding γ1 germline transcripts and inhibited efficient class switching to the immunoglobulin G1 isotype. These studies show that FOXP1 is physiologically downregulated in GC B cells and that aberrant expression of FOXP1 impairs mechanisms triggered by B-cell activation, potentially contributing to B-cell lymphomagenesis.},

  abstract = {Activation of the TCL1 oncogene has been implicated in T cell leukemias/lymphomas and recently was associated with AIDS diffuse large B cell lymphomas (AIDS-DLBCL). Also, in nonmalignant lymphoid tissues, antibody staining has shown that mantle zone B cells expressed abundant Tcl1 protein, whereas germinal center (GC; centrocytes and centroblasts) B cells showed markedly reduced expression. Here, we analyze isolated B cell subsets from hyperplastic tonsil to determine a more precise pattern of Tcl1 expression with development. We also examine multiple B cell lines and B lymphoma patient samples to determine whether different tumor classes retain or alter the developmental pattern of expression. We show that TCL1 expression is not affected by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection and is high in naïve B cells, reduced in GC B cells, and absent in memory B cells and plasma cells. Human herpesvirus-8 infected primary effusion lymphomas (PEL) and multiple myelomas are uniformly TCL1 negative, whereas all other transformed B cell lines tested express moderate to abundant TCL1. This observation supports the hypothesis that PEL, like myeloma, usually arise from post-GC stages of B cell development. Tcl1 protein is also detected in most naïve/GC-derived B lymphoma patient samples (23 of 27 [85\%] positive), whereas most post-GC–derived B lymphomas lack expression (10 of 41 [24\%] positive). These data indicate that the pattern of Tcl1 expression is distinct between naïve/GC and post-GC–derived B lymphomas (P {$<$} 0.001) and that the developmental pattern of expression is largely retained. However, post-GC–derived AIDS-DLBCL express TCL1 at a frequency equivalent to naïve/GC-derived B lymphomas in immune-competent individuals (7 of 9 [78\%] positive), suggesting that TCL1 down-regulation is adversely affected by severe immune system dysfunction. These findings demonstrate that TCL1 expression in B cell lymphoma usually reflects the stage of B cell development from which they derive, except in AIDS-related lymphomas.},

These core TFs collectively regulate their own gene expression, thus forming an interconnected auto-regulatory loop that can be considered the core transcriptional regulatory circuitry (CRC) for that cell type. There is limited knowledge of core TFs, and thus models of core regulatory circuitry, for most cell types. We recently discovered that genes encoding known core TFs forming CRCs are driven by super-enhancers, which provides an opportunity to systematically predict CRCs in poorly studied cell types through super-enhancer mapping. Here, we use super-enhancer maps to generate CRC models for 75 human cell and tissue types. These core circuitry models should prove valuable for further investigating cell-type–specific transcriptional regulation in healthy and diseased cells.},

The biological function of BCL6 is only partially understood because no more than a few genes have been functionally characterized as direct targets of BCL6 transrepression activity. Here we report that the anti-apoptotic proto-oncogene BCL2 is a direct target of BCL6 in GC B cells. BCL6 binds to the BCL2 promoter region by interacting with the transcriptional activator Miz1 and suppresses Miz1-induced activation of BCL2 expression. BCL6-mediated suppression of BCL2 is lost in FL and DLBCL, where the 2 proteins are pathologically coexpressed, because of BCL2 chromosomal translocations and other mechanisms, including Miz1 deregulation and somatic mutations in the BCL2 promoter region. These results identify an important function for BCL6 in facilitating apoptosis of GC B cells via suppression of BCL2, and suggest that blocking this pathway is critical for lymphomagenesis.},

  abstract = {The BCL6 proto-oncogene encodes a transcriptional repressor necessary for the development of germinal centers (GCs) and directly implicated in lymphomagenesis. Post-GC development of B cells requires BCL6 downregulation, while its constitutive expression caused by chromosomal translocations leads to diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Herein we identify a signaling pathway that downregulates BCL6 expression in normal GC B cells and is blocked in a subset of DLBCL due to alterations in the BCL6 gene. Activation of the CD40 receptor leads to NF-kappaB-mediated induction of the IRF4 transcription factor, which, in turn, represses BCL6 expression by binding to its promoter region. A subset of DLBCL displays chromosomal translocations or mutations that disrupt the IRF4-responsive region in the BCL6 promoter and block its downregulation by CD40 signaling.},

  abstract = {Juvenile brain has a unique time window, or critical period, in which neuronal circuits are remodeled by experience. Mounting evidence indicates the importance of neuronal circuit rewiring in various neurodevelopmental disorders of human cognition. We previously showed that Otx2 homeoprotein, essential for brain formation, is recaptured during postnatal maturation of parvalbumin-positive interneurons (PV cells) to activate the critical period in mouse visual cortex. Cortical Otx2 is the only interneuron-enriched transcription factor known to regulate the critical period, but its downstream targets remain unknown. Here, we used ChIP-seq (chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing) to identify genome-wide binding sites of Otx2 in juvenile mouse cortex, and interneuron-specific RNA-seq to explore the Otx2-dependent transcriptome. Otx2-bound genes were associated with human diseases such as schizophrenia as well as critical periods. Of these genes, expression of neuronal factors involved in transcription, signal transduction and mitochondrial function was moderately and broadly affected in Otx2-deficient interneurons. In contrast to reported binding sites in the embryo, genes encoding potassium ion transporters such as KV3.1 had juvenile cortex-specific binding sites, suggesting that Otx2 is involved in regulating fast-spiking properties during PV cell maturation. Moreover, transcripts of oxidative resistance-1 (Oxr1), whose promoter has Otx2 binding sites, were markedly downregulated in Otx2-deficient interneurons. Therefore, an important role of Otx2 may be to protect the cells from the increased oxidative stress in fast-spiking PV cells. Our results suggest that coordinated expression of Otx2 targets promotes PV cell maturation and maintains its function in neuronal plasticity and disease.},

  abstract = {Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) demonstrates a global down-regulation of miR-15a and miR-16 and a selective silencing of the related miR-29b in aggressive disease. Deletions in chromosome 13 [del(13q14)] partially account for the loss of expression of miR-15a and miR-16, but the mechanisms by which miR-29b becomes silenced is unknown. In the present study, we show that the histone deacetylases (HDACs) are overexpressed in CLL and mediate the epigenetic silencing of miR-15a, miR-16, and miR-29b. HDAC inhibition triggered the accumulation of the transcriptionally activating chromatin modification H3K4me2 and restored the expression of miR-15a, miR-16, and miR-29b in approximately 35\% of samples. Ectopic expression of miR-15a and miR-16 and HDAC inhibition–induced expression of miR-15a, miR-16, or miR-29b in primary CLL cells was associated with declines in the levels of Mcl-1, but not Bcl-2, mitochondrial dysfunction, and induction of cell death. Therefore, our results show that HDACs aberrantly silence the expression of the critical tumor suppressors miR-15a, miR-16, and miR-29b in CLL. Deacetylase inhibition may be a therapeutic strategy that restores the expression of these miRs to antagonize Mcl-1, an important survival protein in these cells. Consequently, CLL patients who exhibit such epigenetic silencing may benefit from HDAC inhibitor–based therapy.},

  abstract = {All cells of the body, regardless of the tissue type, contain the same genetic material, but express this genetic material differently. Epigenetics is one process by which differential gene expression within a cell is regulated. Epigenetic mechanisms involve postsynthetic modifications to DNA and/or DNA-associated histones that do not change the DNA sequence itself, but which remodel chromatin, are passed along at each cell division, and occur during and after early development. The CD4+ T cell best represents a cell in which epigenetic mechanisms are used to affect mature cell physiology. As a naïve CD4+ T cell develops into either a Th1 or Th2 cell that secretes predominantly IFN-γ or IL-4, respectively, the expression of one cytokine gene and the permanent silencing of the other is orchestrated using epigenetic mechanisms. Because there appears to be an association between Th1/Th2 cell immunity, behavior, and/or disease, it is possible that an environmentally induced epigenetic change that occurs during Th1/Th2 cell development could explain how certain Th1/Th2-associated conditions develop. This article will review basic epigenetic mechanisms and what is known about how these mechanisms influence cytokine gene expression in a naïve CD4+ T cell as it develops into a Th1 or Th2 cell.},

  abstract = {Environmental factors interact with the genome throughout life to determine gene expression and, consequently, tissue function and disease risk. One such factor that is known to play an important role in determining long-term metabolic health is diet during critical periods of development. Epigenetic regulation of gene expression has been implicated in mediating these programming effects of early diet. The precise epigenetic mechanisms that underlie these effects remain largely unknown. Here, we show that the transcription factor Hnf4a, which has been implicated in the etiology of type 2 diabetes (T2D), is epigenetically regulated by maternal diet and aging in rat islets. Transcriptional activity of Hnf4a in islets is restricted to the distal P2 promoter through its open chromatin configuration and an islet-specific interaction between the P2 promoter and a downstream enhancer. Exposure to suboptimal nutrition during early development leads to epigenetic silencing at the enhancer region, which weakens the P2 promoter–enhancer interaction and results in a permanent reduction in Hnf4a expression. Aging leads to progressive epigenetic silencing of the entire Hnf4a locus in islets, an effect that is more pronounced in rats exposed to a poor maternal diet. Our findings provide evidence for environmentally induced epigenetic changes at the Hnf4a enhancer that alter its interaction with the P2 promoter, and consequently determine T2D risk. We therefore propose that environmentally induced changes in promoter-enhancer interactions represent a fundamental epigenetic mechanism by which nutrition and aging can influence long-term health.},

In contrast to K27M mutation, it remains elusive how G34 mutations affect the epigenome. Here we performed whole-genome bisulfite sequencing of four G34R-mutated gliomas and the G34V-mutated glioma cell line KNS-42 for comparison with gliomas harboring K27M and no mutations in H3F3A and with G34W-mutated bone tumors. G34R-mutated gliomas exhibited lower global methylation levels, similar CpG island (CGI) methylation levels, and compromised hypermethylation of telomere-proximal CGIs, compared to the other two glioma subgroups. Hypermethylated regions specific to G34R-mutated gliomas were enriched for CGIs, including those of OLIG1, OLIG2, and canonical histone genes in the HIST1 cluster. They were notably hypermethylated in osteosarcomas with, but not without, G34W mutation. Independent component analysis revealed that G34 mutation-specific components shared a significant similarity between glioma and osteosarcoma, suggesting that G34 mutations exert characteristic methylomic effects regardless of the tumor tissue-of-origin. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated disruption of G34V-allele in KNS-42 cells led to demethylation of a subset of CGIs hypermethylated in G34R-mutated gliomas. These findings will provide a basis for elucidating epigenomic roles of G34 oncohistone in tumorigenesis.},

By network-based transcriptomics, we identified sulfatase 2 (Sulf2) mRNA in activated human primary OPCs. Sulf2, an extracellular endosulfatase, modulates the signaling microenvironment by editing the pattern of sulfation on heparan sulfate proteoglycans. We found that Sulf2 was increased in demyelinating lesions in multiple sclerosis and was actively secreted by human OPCs. In experimental demyelination, elevated OPC Sulf1/2 expression directly impaired progenitor recruitment and subsequent generation of oligodendrocytes thereby limiting remyelination. Sulf1/2 potentiates the inhibitory microenvironment by promoting BMP and WNT signaling in OPCs. Importantly, pharmacological sulfatase inhibition using PI-88 accelerated oligodendrocyte recruitment and remyelination by blocking OPC-expressed sulfatases. Our findings define an important inhibitory role of Sulf1/2 and highlight the potential for modulation of the heparanome in the treatment of chronic demyelinating disease., Demyelination results in impairments in oligodendrocyte progenitor cell recruitment. Here the authors identify sulfatase 1/2 as a potential modulator of myelination by modulating the microenvironment around oligodendrocyte progenitor cells.},

  abstract = {Background Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 is a component of the Polycomb repressive complex 2 that mediates chromatin-based gene silencing through trimethylation of lysine 27 on histone H3. This complex plays vital roles in the regulation of development-specific gene expression. Design and Methods In this study, a comparative microarray analysis of gene expression in primary adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma samples was performed, and the results were evaluated for their oncogenic and clinical significance. Results Significantly higher levels of Enhancr of zeste homolog 2 and RING1 and YY1 binding protein transcripts with enhanced levels of trimethylation of lysine 27 on histone H3 were found in adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma cells compared with those in normal CD4+ T cells. Furthermore, there was an inverse correlation between the expression level of Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 and that of miR-101 or miR-128a, suggesting that the altered expression of the latter miRNAs accounts for the overexpression of the former. Patients with high Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 or RING1 and YY1 binding protein transcripts had a significantly worse prognosis than those without it, indicating a possible role of these genes in the oncogenesis and progression of this disease. Indeed, adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma cells were sensitive to a histone methylation inhibitor, 3-deazaneplanocin A. Furthermore, 3-deazaneplanocin A and histone deacetylase inhibitor panobinostat showed a synergistic effect in killing the cells Conclusions These findings reveal that adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma cells have deregulated Polycomb repressive complex 2 with over-expressed Enhancer of zeste homolog 2, and that there is the possibility of a new therapeutic strategy targeting histone methylation in this disease.},

  abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) comprise species of short noncoding RNA that regulate gene expression post?transcriptionally. Recent studies have demonstrated that epigenetic mechanisms, including DNA methylation and histone modification, not only regulate the expression of protein?encoding genes, but also miRNAs, such as let?7a, miR?9, miR?34a, miR?124, miR?137, miR?148 and miR?203. Conversely, another subset of miRNAs controls the expression of important epigenetic regulators, including DNA methyltransferases, histone deacetylases and polycomb group genes. This complicated network of feedback between miRNAs and epigenetic pathways appears to form an epigenetics?miRNA regulatory circuit, and to organize the whole gene expression profile. When this regulatory circuit is disrupted, normal physiological functions are interfered with, contributing to various disease processes. The present minireview details recent discoveries involving the epigenetics?miRNA regulatory circuit, suggesting possible biological insights into gene?regulatory mechanisms that may underlie a variety of diseases.},

  abstract = {Although bioinformatics is becoming increasingly central to research in the life sciences, bioinformatics skills and knowledge are not well integrated into undergraduate biology education. This curricular gap prevents biology students from harnessing the full potential of their education, limiting their career opportunities and slowing research innovation. To advance the integration of bioinformatics into life sciences education, a framework of core bioinformatics competencies is needed. To that end, we here report the results of a survey of biology faculty in the United States about teaching bioinformatics to undergraduate life scientists. Responses were received from 1,260 faculty representing institutions in all fifty states with a combined capacity to educate hundreds of thousands of students every year. Results indicate strong, widespread agreement that bioinformatics knowledge and skills are critical for undergraduate life scientists as well as considerable agreement about which skills are necessary. Perceptions of the importance of some skills varied with the respondent’s degree of training, time since degree earned, and/or the Carnegie Classification of the respondent’s institution. To assess which skills are currently being taught, we analyzed syllabi of courses with bioinformatics content submitted by survey respondents. Finally, we used the survey results, the analysis of the syllabi, and our collective research and teaching expertise to develop a set of bioinformatics core competencies for undergraduate biology students. These core competencies are intended to serve as a guide for institutions as they work to integrate bioinformatics into their life sciences curricula.},

Specifically, NIa from tobacco etch virus (TEV)-Oxnard, but not from most other strains, confers the ability to move long distances in Nicotiana tabacum cultivar “V-20.” This led to the hypothesis that all or part of NIa may interact with one or more cellular factors. To identify cellular proteins that interact with NIa in a host- or strain-specific manner, a yeast two-hybrid search of a tomato cDNA library was done. Ten proteins that interacted with NIa were recovered, with translation initiation factor eIF4E being by far the most common protein identified. Interaction of eIF4E with NIa was shown to be TEV strain-specific. eIF4E from both tomato and tobacco interacted well with NIa from the HAT strain, but not from the Oxnard strain. However, using chimeric NIa proteins, the determinant for systemic infection of V20 plants was found to be genetically distinct from the determinant controlling eIF4E interaction. In TEV–eIF4E coexpression experiments, evidence suggesting that eIF4E provides a positive effect on genome amplification was obtained.},

Conditional mutagenesis demonstrated that the Pax5-regulated genes require continuous Pax5 activity for normal expression in pro-B and mature B cells. Expression of half of the Pax5-activated genes is either absent or substantially reduced upon Pax5 loss in plasma cells. Direct Pax5 target genes were identified based on their protein synthesis-independent activation by a Pax5-estrogen receptor fusion protein. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) of Pax5 together with chromatin profiling by~ChIP-on-chip analysis demonstrated that Pax5 directly activates the chromatin at promoters or putative enhancers of Pax5 target genes. The Pax5-activated genes code for key regulatory and structural proteins involved in B cell signaling, adhesion, migration, antigen presentation, and germinal-center B cell formation, thus revealing a complex regulatory network that is activated by Pax5 to control B cell development and function.},

  abstract = {The telltale DNA in lymphoma Diffuse large B cell lymphoma is a relatively common type of tumor that can exhibit a wide range of behaviors, from indolent and curable cancers to ones that are very aggressive and difficult to treat. By analyzing DNA in tumor samples and blood of lymphoma patients, Scherer et al. have shown that specific genetic characteristics can determine each tumor’s cell of origin and identify tumors that are going to transform into more aggressive subtypes and may require more intensive treatment. The authors also demonstrated that circulating tumor DNA in the patients’ blood is suitable for this analysis, allowing for periodic monitoring of each patient without repeated invasive biopsies. Patients with diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) exhibit marked diversity in tumor behavior and outcomes, yet the identification of poor-risk groups remains challenging. In addition, the biology underlying these differences is incompletely understood. We hypothesized that characterization of mutational heterogeneity and genomic evolution using circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) profiling could reveal molecular determinants of adverse outcomes. To address this hypothesis, we applied cancer personalized profiling by deep sequencing (CAPP-Seq) analysis to tumor biopsies and cell-free DNA samples from 92 lymphoma patients and 24 healthy subjects. At diagnosis, the amount of ctDNA was found to strongly correlate with clinical indices and was independently predictive of patient outcomes. We demonstrate that ctDNA genotyping can classify transcriptionally defined tumor subtypes, including DLBCL cell of origin, directly from plasma. By simultaneously tracking multiple somatic mutations in ctDNA, our approach outperformed immunoglobulin sequencing and radiographic imaging for the detection of minimal residual disease and facilitated noninvasive identification of emergent resistance mutations to targeted therapies. In addition, we identified distinct patterns of clonal evolution distinguishing indolent follicular lymphomas from those that transformed into DLBCL, allowing for potential noninvasive prediction of histological transformation. Collectively, our results demonstrate that ctDNA analysis reveals biological factors that underlie lymphoma clinical outcomes and could facilitate individualized therapy. Circulating tumor DNA reveals patterns of clonal evolution and allows classification of tumor subtypes in lymphoma.

Overexpression of Spi-B in CD19+ B cells inhibited, similar to the known inhibitor BCL-6, the expression of plasma cell–associated surface markers and transcription factors as well as immunoglobulin production, ie, in vitro plasma cell differentiation. The arrest in B-cell differentiation enforced by Spi-B was independent of the transactivation domain, but dependent on the Ets-domain. By chromatin immunoprecipitation and assays using an inducible Spi-B construct BLIMP1 and XBP-1 were identified as direct target genes of Spi-B mediated repression. We propose a novel role for Spi-B in maintenance of germinal center and memory B cells by direct repression of major plasma cell factors and thereby plasma cell differentiation.},

In this study, we analyzed cases of FL in situ (FLIS) without manifest FL (mFL), partial involvement by FL (PFL) and paired cases of FLIS and mFL to detect possible early chromosomal imbalances, mutations, as well as DNA-methylation patterns of genomic regions of selected genes. We demonstrate that all paired FLIS and mFL cases were clonally related, based on IGH rearrangement patterns and BCL2 breakpoint sequences. FLIS and PFL had no or few secondary chromosomal imbalances detectable by array comparative genomic hybridization (FLIS 0.8 copy number alterations (CNA)/case; PFL 2.0 CNA/case; mFL 6.3 CNA/case) and a lower level of DNA methylation of genes recurrently de novo methylated in lymphomas, as compared with mFL. EZH2 Tyr641 mutations were detected in a subset of both FLIS (2/9) and PFL (1/3) cases. In conclusion, these findings provide evidence that FLIS represents a FL precursor lesion of long-lived clonal B cells carrying the t(14;18) with no or few secondary genetic changes.

  abstract = {KIR3DL2 is a member of the killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) family that was initially identified at the surface of natural killer (NK) cells. KIR3DL2, also known as CD158k, is expressed as a disulfide-linked homodimer. Each chain is composed of three immunoglobulin-like domains and a long cytoplasmic tail containing two immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs. Beside its expression on NK cells, it is also found on rare circulating T lymphocytes, mainly CD8+. Although the KIR gene number varies between haplotype, KIR3DL2 is a framework gene present in all individuals. Together with the presence of genomic regulatory sequences unique to KIR3DL2, this suggests some particular functions for the derived protein in comparison with other KIR family members. Several ligands have been identified for KIR3DL2. As for other KIRs, binding to HLA class I molecules is essential for NK development by promoting phenomena such as licensing and driving NK cell maturation. For KIR3DL2, this includes binding to HLA-A3 and -A11 and to the free heavy chain form of HLA-B27. In addition, KIR3DL2 binds to CpG oligonucleotides (ODN) and ensures their transport to endosomal toll-like receptor 9 that promotes cell activation. These characteristics have implicated KIR3DL2 in several pathologies: ankylosing spondylitis and cutaneous T-cell lymphomas such as Sézary syndrome, CD30+ cutaneous lymphoma, and transformed mycosis fungoides. Consequently, a new generation of humanized monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) directed against KIR3DL2 has been helpful in the diagnosis, follow-up, and treatment of these diseases. In addition, preliminary clinical studies of a novel targeted immunotherapy for cutaneous T-cell lymphomas using the anti-KIR3DL2 mAb IPH4102 are now underway. In this review, we discuss the various aspects of KIR3DL2 on the functions of CD4+ T cells and how targeting this receptor helps to develop innovative therapeutic strategies.},

  abstract = {IgA Abs help to maintain homeostasis at mucosal surfaces by promoting defense mechanisms that protect against pathogens while suppressing inflammatory responses to commensal organisms and food Ags. The polymeric Ig receptor (pIgR) mediates transport of IgA across mucosal epithelial cells. We hypothesized that signaling through TLRs may up-regulate pIgR expression by intestinal epithelial cells and thus enhance IgA-mediated homeostasis. To test this hypothesis we treated the HT29 human intestinal epithelial cell line with dsRNA, a ligand for TLR3, or LPS, a ligand for TLR4. Both dsRNA and LPS up-regulated levels of pIgR mRNA and cell surface pIgR protein. By contrast, dsRNA but not LPS up-regulated expression of TLR3 and TLR4 mRNA. However, cell surface expression of both TLR3 and TLR4 was enhanced by treatment of HT29 cells with their respective ligands. Transfection of HT29 cells with wild-type and mutated promoter/enhancer plasmids suggested that TLR3 and TLR4 signal primarily through NF-κB to enhance transcription of pIgR mRNA. TLR3 signaling resulted in a more pronounced inflammatory response than did TLR4, as evidenced by up-regulation of the transcription factor IFN regulatory factor-1, chemokines IL-8 and RANTES, and the proinflammatory cytokine TNF. Signaling through LPS/TLR4 appears to up-regulate pIgR expression while minimizing proinflammatory responses, a mechanism that could promote IgA-mediated homeostasis in the presence of commensal Gram-negative bacteria.},

However, a more dynamic role for chromatin in transcriptional regulation is materializing: enhancer elements interact with promoters forming loops that often bridge considerable distances and genomic loci, even located on different chromosomes, undergo chromosomal associations. These associations amass to form an extensive ‘transcriptional interactome’, enacted at functional subnuclear compartments, to which genes dynamically relocate. The emerging view is that long-range chromosomal associations between genomic regions, and their repositioning in the three-dimensional space of the nucleus, are key contributors to the regulation of gene expression.},

RNA-seq data have recently shown that BCL2 is the most highly mutated gene in germinal center B-cell (GCB) DLBCL. We have sequenced BCL2 in 298 primary DLBCL biopsies, 131 additional non-Hodgkin lymphoma biopsies, 24 DLBCL cell lines and 51 germline DNAs. We found frequent BCL2 mutations in follicular lymphoma (FL) and GCB DLBCL, but low levels of BCL2 mutations in activated B-cell DLBCL, mantle cell lymphoma, small lymphocytic leukemia and peripheral T-cell lymphoma. We found no BCL2 mutations in GC centroblasts. Many mutations were non-synonymous; they were preferentially located in the flexible loop domain, with few in BCL2-homology domains. An elevated transition/transversions ratio supports that the mutations result from somatic hypermutation. BCL2 translocations correlate with, and are likely important in acquisition of, additional BCL2 mutations in GCB DLBCL and FL. DLBCL mutations were not independently associated with survival. Although previous studies of BCL2 mutations in FL have reported mutations to result in pseudo-negative BCL2 protein expression, we find this rare in de-novo DLBCL.},

  abstract = {Summary Transcriptional dysregulation of the MYC oncogene is among the most frequent events in aggressive tumor cells, and this is generally accomplished by acquisition of a super-enhancer somewhere within the 2.8 Mb TAD where MYC resides. We find that these diverse cancer-specific super-enhancers, differing in size and location, interact with the MYC gene through a common and conserved CTCF binding site located 2 kb upstream of the MYC promoter. Genetic perturbation of this enhancer-docking site in tumor cells reduces CTCF binding, super-enhancer interaction, MYC gene expression, and cell proliferation. CTCF binding is highly sensitive to DNA methylation, and this enhancer-docking site, which is hypomethylated in diverse cancers, can be inactivated through epigenetic editing with dCas9-DNMT. Similar enhancer-docking sites occur at other genes, including genes with prominent roles in multiple cancers, suggesting a mechanism by which tumor cell oncogenes can generally hijack enhancers. These results provide insights into mechanisms that allow a single target gene to be regulated by diverse enhancer elements in different cell types.},

Testing diverse genetic and epigenetic features, here we show that mutation rates in cancer genomes are strikingly related to chromatin organization. Indeed, at the megabase scale, a single feature—levels of the heterochromatin-associated histone modification H3K9me3—can account for more than 40\% of mutation-rate variation, and a combination of features can account for more than 55\%. The strong association between mutation rates and chromatin organization is upheld in samples from different tissues and for different mutation types. This suggests that the arrangement of the genome into heterochromatin- and euchromatin-like domains is a dominant influence on regional mutation-rate variation in human somatic cells.},

For this purpose, we used array-based intermediate-high resolution genomic profiling in combination with Affymetrix™ gene expression analysis. Tumor specimens from 128 FL patients were analyzed for the presence of genomic aberrations and the results were correlated to clinical data sets and mRNA expression levels. In 114 (89\%) of the 128 analyzed cases, a total of 688 genomic aberrations (384 gains/amplifications and 304 losses) were detected. Frequent genomic aberrations were: −1p36 (18\%), +2p15 (24\%), −3q (14\%), −6q (25\%), +7p (19\%), +7q (23\%), +8q (14\%), −9p (16\%), −11q (15\%), +12q (20\%), −13q (11\%), −17p (16\%), +18p (18\%), and +18q (28\%). Critical segments of these imbalances were delineated to genomic fragments with a minimum size down to 0.2 Mb. By comparison of these with mRNA gene expression data, putative candidate genes were identified. Moreover, we found that deletions affecting the tumor suppressor gene CDKN2A/B on 9p21 were detected in nontransformed FL grade I–II.

The purpose of this study was to use gene expression profiling to identify pathways associated with tumor metabolic response. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: This was a prospective tissue collection study for gene expression profiling of 62 pretreatment biopsies from patients with advanced cervical cancer. Patients were treated with definitive radiation. Fifty-three patients received concurrent chemotherapy. All patients underwent a pretreatment and a 3-month posttherapy FDG-PET/computed tomography (CT). Tumor RNA was harvested from fresh frozen tissue and hybridized to Affymetrix U133Plus2 GeneChips. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was used to identify signaling pathways associated with tumor metabolic response. Immunohistochemistry and in vitro FDG uptake assays were used to confirm our results. RESULTS: There were 40 biopsies from patients with a complete metabolic response (PET-negative group) and 22 biopsies from patients with incomplete metabolic response (PET-positive group). The 3-year cause-specific survival estimates were 98\% for the PET-negative group and 39\% for the PET-positive group (P {$<$} 0.0001). GSEA identified alterations in expression of genes associated with the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in patients with a positive follow-up PET. Immunohistochemistry using a tissue microarray of 174 pretreatment biopsies confirmed p-Akt as a biomarker for poor prognosis in cervical cancer. The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor LY294002 inhibited FDG uptake in vitro in cervical cancer cell lines. CONCLUSIONS: Activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway is associated with incomplete metabolic response in cervical cancer. Targeted inhibition of PI3K/Akt may improve response to chemoradiation.},

This “tonic” BCR survival signal is distinct from that induced by antigen binding and may be ligand-independent. We show that inducible inactivation of the Syk tyrosine kinase, a key signal transducer from the BCR following antigen binding, resulted in the death of most follicular B cells because Syk-deficient cells were unable to survive in response to BAFF. Genetic rescue studies demonstrated that Syk transduces BAFFR survival signals via ERK and PI3 kinase. Surprisingly, BAFFR signaling directly induced phosphorylation of both Syk and the BCR-associated Igα signaling subunit, and this Syk phosphorylation required the BCR. We conclude that the BCR and Igα may be required for B cell survival because they function as adaptor proteins in a BAFFR signaling pathway leading to activation of Syk, demonstrating previously unrecognized crosstalk between the two receptors.},

  abstract = {ZAP-70 tyrosine kinase is involved in signalling pathways following T-cell receptor stimulation and was originally described only in T cells and natural killer cells. ZAP-70 expression has been reported in normal mouse B lineage cells and in human malignant B lymphocytes, mainly in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) where it correlates with clinical outcome. We analyzed several B-cell lines and ex vivo malignant B cells, ranging from acute lymphoblastic leukemia to multiple myeloma and reflecting different stages of B-cell differentiation, and they showed ZAP-70 expression regardless their maturation stage. We then analyzed by Western blot and flow cytometry different human normal B-lymphocyte subpopulations: naïve, germinal center and memory B cells from tonsils, CD19+ CD5+ cells from cord blood and CD19+ lymphocytes from peripheral blood. All expressed ZAP-70 protein, though at different levels depending on their differentiation, activation and tissue localization. In addition, ZAP-70 expression levels could be modulated following stimulation via the B-cell receptor. These findings implicate a potential role of ZAP-70 in the signalling pathway of B lymphocytes at different maturational stages, indicate that ZAP-70 expression is not a CLL-specific feature among B-cell malignancies and suggest that the absence of ZAP-70 rather than its presence should be considered abnormal for malignant B lymphocytes.},

We previously reported an association of TET2 and DNMT3A mutations in progenitors of patients with angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphomas (AITL). Here, we report on the cooperative effect of Tet2 inactivation and DNMT3A mutation affecting arginine 882 (DNMT3AR882H) using a murine bone marrow transplantation assay. Five out of eighteen primary recipients developed hematological malignancies with one mouse developing an AITL-like disease, two mice presenting acute myeloid leukemia (AML)-like and two others T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL)-like diseases within 6 months following transplantation. Serial transplantations of DNMT3AR882H Tet2−/− progenitors led to a differentiation bias toward the T-cell compartment, eventually leading to AITL-like disease in 9/12 serially transplanted recipients. Expression profiling suggested that DNMT3AR882H Tet2−/− T-ALLs resemble those of NOTCH1 mutant. Methylation analysis of DNMT3AR882H Tet2−/− T-ALLs showed a global increase in DNA methylation affecting tumor suppressor genes and local hypomethylation affecting genes involved in the Notch pathway. Our data confirm the transformation potential of DNMT3AR882H Tet2−/− progenitors and represent the first cooperative model in mice involving Tet2 inactivation driving lymphoid malignancies.},

  abstract = {Impaired Fas-mediated apoptosis is associated with poor clinical outcomes and cancer chemoresistance. Soluble Fas receptor (sFas), produced by skipping of exon 6, inhibits apoptosis by sequestering Fas ligand. Serum sFas is associated with poor prognosis of non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas. We found that the alternative splicing of Fas in lymphomas is tightly regulated by a long-noncoding RNA corresponding to an antisense transcript of Fas (FAS-AS1). Levels of FAS-AS1 correlate inversely with production of sFas, and FAS-AS1 binding to the RBM5 inhibits RBM5-mediated exon 6 skipping. EZH2, often mutated or overexpressed in lymphomas, hyper-methylates the FAS-AS1 promoter and represses the FAS-AS1 expression. EZH2-mediated repression of FAS-AS1 promoter can be released by DZNeP (3-Deazaneplanocin A) or overcome by ectopic expression of FAS-AS1, both of which increase levels of FAS-AS1 and correspondingly decrease expression of sFas. Treatment with Bruton’s tyrosine kinase inhibitor or EZH2 knockdown decreases the levels of EZH2, RBM5 and sFas, thereby enhancing Fas-mediated apoptosis. This is the first report showing functional regulation of Fas repression by its antisense RNA. Our results reveal new therapeutic targets in lymphomas and provide a rationale for the use of EZH2 inhibitors or ibrutinib in combination with chemotherapeutic agents that recruit Fas for effective cell killing.},

First, modifications of DNA, RNA, nucleosomal histones, key principles of chromatin organization, topologically associating domains, and local remodeling will be reviewed. Then, the relationship between epigenetic modulators and RNA processing will be explored. Finally, the reciprocal relationship between the epigenome as a determinant of the mechanical properties of cell nuclei and the target of mechanotransduction will be discussed. The overall goal is to provide an interpretative key on how epigenetic changes may account for the heterogeneity of the transcriptional profiles identified in this lineage.},

We use proximity ligation and sequencing to show that alleles on homologous chromosomes occupy distinct territories, and therefore this experimental protocol preferentially recovers physically linked DNA variants on a homolog. Computational analysis of such data sets allows for accurate (\textasciitilde 99.5\%) reconstruction of chromosome-spanning haplotypes for \textasciitilde 95\% of alleles in hybrid mouse cells with 30× sequencing coverage. To resolve haplotypes for a human genome, which has a low density of variants, we coupled HaploSeq with local conditional phasing to obtain haplotypes for \textasciitilde 81\% of alleles with \textasciitilde 98\% accuracy from just 17× sequencing. Whereas methods based on proximity ligation were originally designed to investigate spatial organization of genomes, our results lend support for their use as a general tool for haplotyping.},

At a morphological level, regions of the genome that are permissive or repressive to gene expression have been associated with these architectural features. However, gene position within the nucleus can be both a cause and a consequence of transcriptional regulation. New results indicate that the spatial distribution of genes within the nucleus contributes to transcriptional control. In some cases, position seems to ensure maximal expression of a gene. In others, it ensures a heritable state of repression or correlates with a developmentally determined program of tissue-specific gene expression. In this review, we highlight mechanistic links between gene position, repression and transcription. Recent findings suggest that architectural features have multiple functions that depend upon organization into dedicated subcompartments enriched for distinct enzymatic machinery.},

Here we present a high-resolution chromosomal contact map derived from a modified genome-wide chromosome conformation capture approach applied to Drosophila embryonic nuclei. The data show that the entire genome is linearly partitioned into well-demarcated physical domains that overlap extensively with active and repressive epigenetic marks. Chromosomal contacts are hierarchically organized between domains. Global modeling of contact density and clustering of domains show that inactive domains are condensed and confined to their chromosomal territories, whereas active domains reach out of the territory to form remote intra- and interchromosomal contacts. Moreover, we systematically identify specific long-range intrachromosomal contacts between Polycomb-repressed domains. Together, these observations allow for quantitative prediction of the Drosophila chromosomal contact map, laying the foundation for detailed studies of chromosome structure and function in a genetically tractable system.},

Using DNA microarrays, we found that introduction of Blimp-1 into B cells blocked expression of a remarkably large set of genes, while a much smaller number was induced. Blimp-1 initiated this cascade of gene expression changes by directly repressing genes encoding several transcription factors, including Spi-B and Id3, that regulate signaling by the B cell receptor. Blimp-1 also inhibited immunoglobulin class switching by blocking expression of AID, Ku70, Ku86, DNA-PKcs, and STAT6. These findings suggest that Blimp-1 promotes plasmacytic differentiation by extinguishing gene expression important for B cell receptor signaling, germinal center B cell function, and proliferation while allowing expression of important plasma cell genes such as XBP-1.},

The signaling pathways that normal B cells utilize to sense antigens are frequently derailed in B cell malignancies, leading to constitutive activation of prosurvival pathways. These malignancies co-opt transcriptional regulatory systems that characterize their normal B cell counterparts and frequently alter epigenetic regulators of chromatin structure and gene expression.

The expression of this factor is involved in several aspects of B-cell differentiation, including commitment, immunoglobulin gene rearrangement, BCR signal transduction and B-cell survival, so that the deletion or inactivating mutations of Pax5 cause cell arrest in Pro-B-cell stage. In recent years, point mutations, deletions and various rearrangements in Pax5 gene have been reported in several types of human cancers. However, no clear relationship has been found between these aberrations and disease prognosis. Specific expression of Pax5 in B-cells can raise it as a marker for the diagnosis and differentiation of B-cell leukemias and lymphomas as well as account for remission or relapse. Extensive studies on Pax5 along with other genes and immunomarkers are necessary for decisive results in this regard.},

  abstract = {The phenotype of germinal center (GC) B cells includes the unique ability to tolerate rapid proliferation and the mutagenic actions of activation induced cytosine deaminase (AICDA). Given the importance of epigenetic patterning in determining cellular phenotypes, we examined DNA methylation and the role of DNA methyltransferases in the formation of GCs. DNA methylation profiling revealed a marked shift in DNA methylation patterning in GC B cells versus resting/naive B cells. This shift included significant differential methylation of 235 genes, with concordant inverse changes in gene expression affecting most notably genes of the NFkB and MAP kinase signaling pathways. GC B cells were predominantly hypomethylated compared with naive B cells and AICDA binding sites were highly overrepresented among hypomethylated loci. GC B cells also exhibited greater DNA methylation heterogeneity than naive B cells. Among DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs), only DNMT1 was significantly up-regulated in GC B cells. Dnmt1 hypomorphic mice displayed deficient GC formation and treatment of mice with the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor decitabine resulted in failure to form GCs after immune stimulation. Notably, the GC B cells of Dnmt1 hypomorphic animals showed evidence of increased DNA damage, suggesting dual roles for DNMT1 in DNA methylation and double strand DNA break repair.},

  abstract = {Purpose of review It has only recently become apparent that mutations in epigenetic mechanisms and perturbation of epigenomic patterning are frequent events in B-cell lymphomas. The purpose of this review is to highlight these new findings and provide a conceptual framework for understanding how epigenetic modifications might contribute to lymphomagenesis. Recent findings Somatic mutations affecting histone methyltransferases such as EZH2 and MLL2, histone demethylases including UTX and JMJD2C and histone acetyltransferases including CBP and p300 are recurrent and common in lymphomas. These mutations result in disruption of chromatin structure and functions of other proteins, ultimately causing aberrant transcriptional programming affecting multiple gene networks. Widespread perturbation of cytosine methylation patterning now appears to be a hallmark of B-cell lymphomas and occurs in specific patterns that can distinguish disease subtypes. Therapeutic targeting strategies can overcome abnormal epigenetic mechanisms and potently kill lymphoma cells. Summary Newly discovered epigenetic lesions may provide critical insights into the genesis of B-cell lymphomas but further studies are required to understand how they affect biological mechanism. Epigenetic lesions offer tremendous opportunities for the development of improved biomarkers and treatments.},

First, we used the GeCKO library to identify genes essential for cell viability in cancer and pluripotent stem cells. Next, in a melanoma model, we screened for genes whose loss is involved in resistance to vemurafenib, a therapeutic that inhibits mutant protein kinase BRAF. Our highest-ranking candidates include previously validated genes NF1 and MED12 as well as novel hits NF2, CUL3, TADA2B, and TADA1.

However, in response to either TD or TI antigen, serum Ig, short-lived plasma cells, post-GC plasma cells, and plasma cells in a memory response are virtually absent, demonstrating that Blimp-1 is required for plasmacytic differentiation and Ig secretion. In the absence of Blimp-1, CD79b+B220− pre-plasma memory B cell development is also defective, providing evidence that this subset is an intermediate in plasma cell development. B cells lacking Blimp-1 cannot secrete Ig or induce μS mRNA when stimulated ex vivo.

We demonstrate that functional RNA domains up to at least 4.8 kb long can be inserted in CRISPR guide RNA at multiple points, allowing the construction of Cas9 complexes with protein-binding cassettes, artificial aptamers, pools of random sequences and natural long noncoding RNAs. A unique feature of CRISP-Disp is the multiplexing of distinct functions at multiple targets, limited only by the availability of functional RNA motifs.

Single-molecule DNA sequencing determined the exact location of these modified nucleosomes in the genome. Science, this issue p. 717 Different combinations of histone modifications have been proposed to signal distinct gene regulatory functions, but this area is poorly addressed by existing technologies. We applied high-throughput single-molecule imaging to decode combinatorial modifications on millions of individual nucleosomes from pluripotent stem cells and lineage-committed cells. We identified definitively bivalent nucleosomes with concomitant repressive and activating marks, as well as other combinatorial modification states whose prevalence varies with developmental potency. We showed that genetic and chemical perturbations of chromatin enzymes preferentially affect nucleosomes harboring specific modification states. Last, we combined this proteomic platform with single-molecule DNA sequencing technology to simultaneously determine the modification states and genomic positions of individual nucleosomes. This single-molecule technology has the potential to address fundamental questions in chromatin biology and epigenetic regulation.

It is of particular importance to compare ChIP-seq data of two different conditions, such as disease vs. control, and identify regions that show differences in ChIP enrichment. We have developed a powerful and easy to use program, called diffReps, to detect those differential sites from ChIP-seq data, with or without biological replicates. In addition, we have developed two useful tools for ChIP-seq analysis in the diffReps package: one for the annotation of the differential sites and the other for finding chromatin modification “hotspots”. diffReps is developed in PERL programming language and runs on all platforms as a command line script. We tested diffReps on two different datasets. One is the comparison of H3K4me3 between two human cell lines from the ENCODE project. The other is the comparison of H3K9me3 in a discrete region of mouse brain between cocaine- and saline-treated conditions. The results indicated that diffReps is a highly sensitive program in detecting differential sites from ChIP-seq data.},

  abstract = {The biogenesis of the many functional compartments contained in the mammalian cell nucleus is poorly understood. More specifically, little is known regarding the initial nucleation step required for nuclear body formation. Here we show that RNA can function as a structural element and a nucleator of nuclear bodies. We find that several types of coding and noncoding RNAs are sufficient to de novo assemble, and are physiologically enriched in, histone locus bodies (with associated Cajal bodies), nuclear speckles, paraspeckles and nuclear stress bodies. Formation of nuclear bodies occurs through recruitment and accumulation of proteins resident in the nuclear bodies by nucleating RNA. These results demonstrate that transcription is a driving force in nuclear body formation and RNA transcripts can function as a scaffold in the formation of major nuclear bodies. Together, these data suggest that RNA-primed biogenesis of nuclear bodies is a general principle of nuclear organization.},

  abstract = {Toll-like receptors (TLRs), as the most important pattern recognition receptors in innate immunity, play a pivotal role in inducing immune response through recognition of microbial invaders or specific agonists. Recent studies have suggested that TLRs could serve as important regulators in the development of a variety of cancer. However, increasing evidences have shown that TLRs may display quite opposite outcomes in cancer development. Although several potential therapeutic Toll-like receptor ligands have been found, the mechanism and therapy prospect of TLRs in cancer development has to be further elucidated to accelerate the clinical application. By performing a systematic review of the present findings on TLRs in cancer immunology, we attempted to evaluate the therapeutic potential of TLRs in cancer therapy and elucidate the potential mechanism of cancer progress regulated by TLR signaling and the reported targets on TLRs for clinical application. An electronic databases search was conducted in PubMed, Chinese Scientific Journal Database, and Chinese Biomedical Literature Database from their inception to February 1, 2016. The following keywords were used to search the databases: Toll-like receptors, cancer therapy, therapeutic target, innate immunity. Of 244 studies that were identified, 97 nonrelevant studies were excluded. In total, 147 full-text articles were assessed, and from these, 54 were excluded as they did not provide complete key information. Thus, 93 studies were considered eligible and included in the analysis. According to the data from the included trials, 14 TLR ligands (77.8\%) from 82 studies have been demonstrated to display antitumor property in various cancers, whereas 4 ligands (22.2\%) from 11 studies promote tumors. Among them, only 3 TLR ligands have been approved for cancer therapy, and 9 ligands were in clinical trials. In addition, the potential mechanism of recently reported targets on TLRs for clinical application was also evaluated in this review. We show that targeting TLRs in cancer immunotherapy is a promising strategy for cancer therapy, and the specific TLR ligands, either alone or combination, exhibit antitumor potential.},

Unlike poly-IgR, Fcα/μR is expressed on marginal zone (MZ) B cells and follicular dendritic cells, suggesting that Fcα/μR plays an important role in humoral immune responses. Fcα/μR mediates endocytosis of the IgM immune complex (IC). Recent research demonstrated that Fcα/μR downregulated retention of the IgM IC with a T-independent (TI) antigen on MZ B cells and follicular dendritic cells due to endocytosis of the IgM IC, suppressing germinal center formation, affinity maturation, and memory B-cell generation in response to TI antigen challenge. In addition, Fcα/μR physically associates with Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and augments TLR4 oligomerization and signaling in MZ B cells upon lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge, leading to increased proinflammatory cytokine production by MZ B cells. Thus, Fcα/μR is a unique Fc receptor that is involved in humoral immune responses and inflammation.},

  abstract = {Ab-independent effector functions of B cells, such as Ag presentation and cytokine production, have been shown to play an important role in a variety of immune-mediated conditions such as autoimmune diseases, transplant rejection, and graft-versus-host disease. Most current immunosuppressive treatments target T cells, are relatively unspecific, and result in profound immunosuppression that places patients at an increased risk of developing severe infections and cancer. Therapeutic strategies, which interfere with B cell activation, could therefore be a useful addition to the current immunosuppressive armamentarium. Using a transcriptomic approach, we identified upregulation of genes that belong to the mevalonate pathway as a key molecular event following CD40-mediated activation of B cells. Inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme of the mevalonate pathway, by lipophilic statins such as simvastatin and atorvastatin resulted in a specific inhibition of B cell activation via CD40 and impaired their ability to act as stimulatory APCs for allospecific T cells. Mechanistically, the inhibitory effect resulted from the inhibition of protein geranylgeranylation subsequent to the depletion of mevalonate, the metabolic precursor for geranylgeranyl. Thus, inhibition of geranylgeranylation either directly through geranylgeranyl transferase inhibitors or indirectly through statins represents a promising therapeutic approach for the treatment of diseases in which Ag presentation by B cells plays a role.},

As a result, we identified TOSO/Fas apoptotic inhibitory molecule 3 (FAIM3) as a possible Fc receptor for IgM. HeLa cells transfected with a TOSO/FAIM3-expression vector bound to IgM but not IgG and were able to internalize IgM-conjugated beads but not IgG-conjugated beads, suggesting that TOSO/FAIM3 is indeed a receptor for IgM (FcμR). FcμR protein was expressed predominantly on B-lineage cells; expression of the Fcmr transcripts was observed from the pre-B-cell stage and maintained thereafter during B-cell development.

However, their unique roles in the regulation of thyroid hormone (TH) signaling in specific cell types have not been determined. To accomplish this we generated mice that lacked function of either NCoR1, SMRT, or both in the liver only and additionally a global SMRT knockout model. Despite both corepressors being present in the liver, deletion of SMRT in either euthyroid or hypothyroid animals had little effect on TH signaling. In contrast, disruption of NCoR1 action confirmed that NCoR1 is the principal mediator of TH sensitivity in vivo. Similarly, global disruption of SMRT, unlike the global disruption of NCoR1, did not affect TH levels. While SMRT played little role in TH-regulated pathways, when disrupted in combination with NCoR1, it greatly accentuated the synthesis and storage of hepatic lipid. Taken together, these data demonstrate that corepressor specificity exists in vivo and that NCoR1 is the principal regulator of TH action. However, both corepressors collaborate to control hepatic lipid content, which likely reflects their cooperative activity in regulating the action of multiple NRs including the TH receptor (TR).},

The deficiency in the thermogenesis induced by neuroblast differentiation-associated protein AHNAK in white adipose tissue (WAT) of mice fed a high-fat diet suggests that AHNAK may stimulate energy expenditure via development of beige fat. Here, we report that AHNAK deficiency promoted browning and thermogenic gene expression in WAT but not in brown adipose tissue of mice stimulated with the ADRB3 agonist CL-316243. Consistent with the increased thermogenesis, Ahnak(-/-) mice exhibited an increase in energy expenditure, accompanied by elevated mitochondrial biogenesis in WAT depots in response to CL-316243. Additionally, AHNAK-deficient WAT contained more eosinophils and higher levels of type 2 cytokines (IL-4/IL-13) to promote browning of WAT in response to CL-316243. This was associated with enhanced sympathetic tone in the WAT via upregulation of adrb3 and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) in response to β-adrenergic activation. CL-316243 activated PKA signalling and enhanced lipolysis, as evidenced by increased phosphorylation of hormone-sensitive lipase and release of free glycerol in Ahnak(-/-) mice compared to wild-type mice. Overall, these findings suggest an important role of AHNAK in the regulation of thermogenesis and lipolysis in WAT via β-adrenergic signalling.},

A growing body of evidence indicates that although some genetic alterations are specific to certain diseases, others are shared across different lymphomas. Many such genetic events have already demonstrated clinical utility, such as BRAF V600E that confers sensitivity to vemurafenib in patients with hairy cell leukemia.         Summary~The rareness of many lymphoma subtypes makes the conduct of clinical trials and recruitment of significant numbers of patients impractical. However, a knowledge of the shared genetic origins of these rare lymphomas has the potential to inform ‘basket’ clinical trials in which multiple lymphoma subtypes are included. These trials would include patients based on the presence of alterations in targetable driver genes. Such approaches would be greatly strengthened by a systematic assessment of significant patient numbers from each subtype using next generation sequencing.},

A paucity of functional data led us to investigate the role of super-enhancers in the mammary gland, an organ characterized by exceptional gene regulatory dynamics during pregnancy. ChIP-seq analysis for the master regulator STAT5A, the glucocorticoid receptor, H3K27ac and MED1 identified 440 mammary-specific super-enhancers, half of which were associated with genes activated during pregnancy. We interrogated the Wap super-enhancer, generating mice carrying mutations in STAT5-binding sites within its constituent enhancers. Individually, the most distal site displayed the greatest enhancer activity. However, combinatorial mutation analysis showed that the 1,000-fold induction in gene expression during pregnancy relied on all enhancers. Disabling the binding sites of STAT5, NFIB and ELF5 in the proximal enhancer incapacitated the entire super-enhancer. Altogether, these data suggest a temporal and functional enhancer hierarchy. The identification of mammary-specific super-enhancers and the mechanistic exploration of the Wap locus provide insights into the regulation of cell-type-specific expression of hormone-sensing genes.},

One of these miRNAs, miR-455-5p, has two A-to-I RNA-editing sites. The biological function of edited miR-455-5p is different from that of the unedited form, as it recognizes a different set of genes. Indeed, wild-type miR-455-5p promotes melanoma metastasis through inhibition of the tumour suppressor gene CPEB1. Moreover, wild-type miR-455 enhances melanoma growth and metastasis in~vivo, whereas the edited form inhibits these features.

  abstract = {Interferon Regulatory Factor 4 (IRF4) and IRF8 are critical regulators of immune system development and function. In B lymphocytes, IRF4 and IRF8 have been shown to control important events during their development and maturation including pre-B cell differentiation, induction of B cell tolerance pathways, marginal zone B cell development, germinal center reaction and plasma cell differentiation. Mechanistically, IRF4 and IRF8 are found to function redundantly to control certain stages of B cell development, but in other stages, they function nonredundantly to play distinct roles in B cell biology. In line with their essential roles in B cell development, deregulated expressions of IRF4 and IRF8 have been associated to the pathogenesis of several B cell malignancies and diseases. Recent studies have elucidated diverse transcriptional networks regulated by IRF4 and IRF8 at distinct B cell developmental stages and related malignancies.

  abstract = {Interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF4) is a critical transcriptional regulator of B-cell development and function. A recent genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) association study identified IRF4 as a major susceptibility gene in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Although the SNPs located in the IRF4 gene were linked to a downregulation of IRF4 in CLL patients, whether a low level of IRF4 is critical for CLL development remains unclear. In rodents, CLL cells are derived from B1 cells whose population is dramatically expanded in immunoglobulin heavy chain Vh11 knock-in mice. We bred a Vh11 knock-in allele into IRF4-deficient mice (IRF4−/−Vh11). Here, we report that IRF4−/−Vh11 mice develop spontaneous early-onset CLL with 100\% penetrance. Further analysis shows that IRF4−/−Vh11 CLL cells proliferate predominantly in spleen and express high levels of Mcl-1. IRF4−/−Vh11 CLL cells are resistant to apoptosis but reconstitution of IRF4 expression in the IRF4−/−Vh11 CLL cells inhibits their survival. Thus, our study demonstrates for the first time a causal relationship between low levels of IRF4 and the development of CLL. Moreover, our findings establish IRF4−/−Vh11 mice as a novel mouse model of CLL that not only is valuable for dissecting molecular pathogenesis of CLL but could also be used for therapeutic purposes.},

  abstract = {Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), characterized by the progressive and uncontrolled accumulation of CD19+ B cells, currently remains as an incurable malignancy. The difficulties of eliciting curative measures in CLL are partly driven by the adaptability of the transcriptional response mediated by epigenetic mechanisms. In this study, we sought to better characterize the complexities of the CLL transcriptional profile by conducting an integrative analysis between the B cell enhancer and super enhancer signatures defined from 3 B cell H3K27Ac ChIPseq samples (CD19+ B cell, GM12878, and MEC1), the DNA methylation signatures defined from reduced-representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) of 42 CLL patient and 8 healthy donor samples, and the mRNA expression signatures defined from RNA sequencing of 47 CLL patient and 5 healthy donor samples. From our analysis, we identified super enhancers (SEs) in each of the ChIPseq profiles (approximately 4\% of called enhancers) and discovered 741 SEs in GM12878, 374 SEs in MEC1, and 523 SEs in the CD19+ B cell profiles, respectively. Based on MSigDB gene ontology analysis, many of the genes corresponding with SEs were involved in pathways regulating immune signaling activation (e.g. TNFA\_SIGNALING\_VIA\_NFKB, INFLAMMATORY RESPONSE) or metabolic homeostasis (e.g. MTORC1\_SIGNALING, FATTY\_ACID\_METABOLISM). By further analyzing the corresponding expression level of SE-associated genes in CLL patients, we identified 190 transcripts associated with SEs that were significantly overexpressed in CLL patient B cells (Student's t-test p{$<$}0.05), and this overexpressed subset of SE-associated transcripts was enriched in genes involved in either immune signaling (e.g. LCK, FCER2) or metabolic regulation (e.g. LSR, ENO2). Based on the differential expression of genes associated with enhancers occurring between CLL patient and healthy donor B cells, we then wanted to determine whether differential DNA methylation within enhancers corresponded with upregulation of CLL transcripts. Based on differential DNA methylation (DM) analysis (methylation difference +/- .25; Student's t-test p-value{$<$}0.05) from our RRBS samples, we discovered 744 DM CpG sites that overlapped within our identified B cell enhancers, and most of the DM CpG sites in CLL were significantly hypomethylated (avg. DM GpG difference: enhancer = -0.40; non-enhancer = -0.08). Examples of hypomethylated enhancers included super enhancers corresponding with overexpressed transcripts ENO2, SEPT9, RXRA, and CCR7 as well as a typical enhancer that corresponded with the overexpressed transcript PDCD1. Based on the derived information from our integrative analysis of B cell enhancers, we then compared the effects of preferentially targeting enhancer-mediated expression with either the BET bromodomain inhibitor JQ1 or the cyclin dependent kinase-7 (CDK7) inhibitor THZ1. Based on in vitro assays and RNAseq expression analysis comparing THZ1 and JQ1-treated CLL cell lines MEC1 and MEC2, we saw that JQ1 could inhibit CLL cell line proliferation, suppress IgM-mediated primary CLL proliferation, and differentially disrupt transcription of genes involved in immune signaling cascades. Contrastingly, we saw that THZ1 elicited a different response in CLL cell lines and primary cells by disrupting cell viability, inducing apoptosis, and differentially downregulating genes involved in metabolic homeostasis. The specific enhancer-associated genes disrupted by the respective treatments further highlight the dichotomy of JQ1 and THZ1-mediated effects, as JQ1 selectively suppressed the B cell activation marker gene FCER2 and the PD-1 receptor gene PDCD1, whereas THZ1 selectively suppressed the glycolytic enolase gene ENO2 and the proto-oncogene FGR. Collectively, these results reveal how CLL DNA hypomethylation within B cell enhancers can mediate immune signaling and metabolic expression signatures in CLL and can differentially be disrupted by BET bromodomain or CDK7 inhibition.

  abstract = {Summary It is becoming increasingly clear that transcription factors operate in complex networks through thousands of genomic binding sites, many of which bind several transcription factors. However, the extent and mechanisms of crosstalk between transcription factors at these hotspots remain unclear. Using a combination of advanced proteomics and genomics approaches, we identify ∼12,000 transcription factor hotspots (∼400~bp) in the early phase of adipogenesis, and we find evidence of both simultaneous and sequential binding of transcription factors at these regions. We demonstrate that hotspots are highly enriched in large super-enhancer regions (several kilobases), which drive the early adipogenic reprogramming of gene expression. Our results indicate that cooperativity between transcription factors at the level of hotspots as well as super-enhancers is very important for enhancer activity and transcriptional reprogramming. Thus, hotspots and super-enhancers~constitute important regulatory hubs that serve to integrate external stimuli on chromatin.},

  abstract = {Many membrane traffic events that were previously thought to be constitutive recently have been found to be regulated by a variety of intracellular signaling pathways. The polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR) transcytoses dimeric IgA (dIgA) from the basolateral to the apical surface of polarized epithelial cells. Transcytosis is stimulated by binding of dIgA to the pIgR, indicating that the pIgR can transduce a signal to the cytoplasmic machinery responsible for membrane traffic. We report that dIgA binding to the pIgR causes activation of protein kinase C (PKC) and release of inositol 1,4,5- trisphosphate (IP3). The IP3 causes an elevation of intracellular Ca. Artificially activating PKC with phorbol myristate acetate or poisoning the calcium pump with thapsigargin stimulates transcytosis of pIgR, while the intracellular Ca chelator BAPTA-AM inhibits transcytosis. Our data suggest that ligand-induced signaling by the pIgR may regulate membrane traffic via well-known second messenger pathways involving PKC, IP3, and Ca. This may be a model of a general means by which membrane traffic is regulated by receptor-ligand interaction and signaling pathways.},

However, mechanisms by which extracellular vesicles affect tumor progression are not fully understood. Here, we investigated vesicular communication between mammary carcinoma cells and neighboring nontransformed mammary fibroblasts. Nonbiased proteomic analysis found that over 1\% of the entire proteome is represented in these vesicles, with the neuroblast differentiation associated protein AHNAK and annexin A2 being the most abundant. In particular, AHNAK was found to be the most prominent component of these vesicles based on peptide number, and appeared necessary for their formation. In addition, we report here that carcinoma cells produce vesicles that promote the migration of recipient fibroblasts. These data suggest that AHNAK enables mammary carcinoma cells to produce and release extracellular vesicles that cause disruption of the stroma by surrounding fibroblasts. This paradigm reveals fundamental mechanisms by which vesicular communication between carcinoma cells and stromal cells can promote cancer progression in the tumor microenvironment.},

The prevalence of histone H3 K27M mutations indicates a critical role in DIPGs, but the contribution of the mutation to disease pathogenesis remains unclear. We show that knockdown of this mutation in DIPG xenografts restores K27M-dependent loss of H3K27me3 and delays tumor growth. Comparisons of matched DIPG xenografts with and without K27M knockdown allowed identification of mutation-specific effects on the transcriptome and epigenome. The resulting transcriptional changes recapitulate expression signatures from K27M primary DIPG tumors and are strongly enriched for genes associated with nervous system development. Integrated analysis of ChIP-seq and expression data showed that genes upregulated by the mutation are overrepresented in apparently bivalent promoters. Many of these targets are associated with more immature differentiation states. Expression profiles indicate K27M knockdown decreases proliferation and increases differentiation within lineages represented in DIPG. These data suggest that K27M-mediated loss of H3K27me3 directly regulates a subset of genes by releasing poised promoters, and contributes to tumor phenotype and growth by limiting differentiation. The delayed tumor growth associated with knockdown of H3 K27M provides evidence that this highly recurrent mutation is a relevant therapeutic target.},

The active β-globin locus in fetal liver preferentially contacts transcribed, but not necessarily tissue-specific, loci elsewhere on chromosome 7, whereas the inactive locus in fetal brain contacts different transcriptionally silent loci. A housekeeping gene in a gene-dense region on chromosome 8 forms long-range contacts predominantly with other active gene clusters, both in cis and in trans, and many of these intra- and interchromosomal interactions are conserved between the tissues analyzed.

Sheared chromatin is subjected to phenol/chloroform extraction and the isolated DNA, typically encompassing 1–3\% of the human genome, is purified.

Regulatory elements enriched by FAIRE have high concordance with those identified by nuclease hypersensitivity or chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), and the entire procedure can be completed in 3 d.

  abstract = {A recent meta-analysis of three genome-wide association studies of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) identified two common variants at the 6p21.31 locus that are associated with CLL risk. To verify and further explore the association of these variants with other non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) subtypes, we genotyped 1196 CLL cases, 1699 NHL cases, and 2410 controls. We found significant associations between the 6p21.31 variants and CLL risk (rs210134: P~=~0·01; rs210142: P~=~6·8~×~10−3). These variants also showed a trend towards association with some of the other NHL subtypes. Our results validate the prior work and support specific genetic pathways for risk among NHL subtypes.},

  abstract = {Background: Our genome-wide association study (GWAS) of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) identified 4 highly correlated intronic variants within the IRF8 gene that were associated with CLL. These results were further supported by a recent meta-analysis of our GWAS with two other GWAS of CLL, supporting the IRF8 gene as a strong candidate for CLL risk. Methods: To refine the genetic association of CLL risk, we conducted Sanger sequencing of IRF8 in 94 CLL cases and 96 controls. We then conducted fine mapping by genotyping 39 variants (of which 10 were identified from sequencing) in 745 CLL cases and 1,521 controls. We also assessed these associations with risk of other non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) subtypes. Results: The strongest association with CLL risk was observed with a common single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) located within the 3′ untranslated region (UTR) of IRF8 (rs1044873, log additive OR = 0.7, P = 1.81 × 10−6). This SNP was not associated with the other NHL subtypes (all P {$>$} 0.05). Conclusions: We provide evidence that rs1044873 in the IRF8 gene accounts for the initial GWAS signal for CLL risk. This association appears to be unique to CLL with little support for association with other common NHL subtypes. Future work is needed to assess functional role of IRF8 in CLL etiology. Impact: These data provide support that a functional variant within the 3′UTR of IRF8 may be driving the GWAS signal seen on 16q24.1 for CLL risk.

  abstract = {Enhancers are cis-regulatory elements that enable precise spatiotemporal patterns of gene expression during development and are notable for being able to function at large distances from their target genes. Such regulatory elements often bypass intervening genes and typically comprise binding sites for multiple transcription factors that can also be transcribed by RNA polymerase II (Pol II) to produce noncoding enhancer RNAs (eRNAs). Genome-wide analyses have revealed chromatin signatures of enhancers, such as the enrichment for monomethylation of histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4me1) and the acetylation or methylation of histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27). Enhancer signatures have been used to describe the transitions of these regulatory elements from inactive to primed and from activated to decommissioned states during development. New mutations of enhancer sequences and of the protein factors regulating enhancer function in human disease continue to be identified, contributing to a growing class of 'enhanceropathies'.

  abstract = {We examined genetic and epigenetic changes that occur during disease progression from indolent to aggressive forms of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) using serial samples from 27 patients. Analysis of DNA mutations grouped the leukemia cases into three categories: evolving (26\%), expanding (26\%) and static (47\%). Thus, approximately three-quarters of the CLL cases had little to no genetic subclonal evolution. However, we identified significant recurrent DNA methylation changes during progression at 4752 CpGs enriched for regions near Polycomb 2 repressive complex (PRC2) targets. Progression-associated CpGs near the PRC2 targets undergo methylation changes in the same direction during disease progression as during normal development from naive to memory B cells. Our study shows that CLL progression does not typically occur via subclonal evolution, but that certain CpG sites undergo recurrent methylation changes. Our results suggest CLL progression may involve developmental processes shared in common with the generation of normal memory B cells.},

Their role is to initiate an inflammatory response, phagocyte and kill pathogens, recruit natural killer cells (NK), and facilitate the maturation and migration of dendritic cells that will initiate the adaptive immune response. Extraordinary advances have been made in the last decade on the knowledge of the receptors and mechanisms used by cells of the innate immunity not only to sense and eliminate the pathogen but also to communicate each other and collaborate with cells of adaptive immunity to mount an effective immune response. The analysis of innate immunity in elderly humans has evidenced that aging has a profound impact on the phenotype and functions of these cells. Thus altered expression and/or function of innate immunity receptors and signal transduction leading to defective activation and decreased chemotaxis, phagocytosis and intracellular killing of pathogens have been described. The phenotype and function of NK cells from elderly individuals show significant changes that are compatible with remodeling of the different NK subsets, with a decrease in the CD56bright subpopulation and accumulation of the CD56dim cells, in particular those differentiated NK cells that co-express CD57, as well as a decreased expression of activating natural cytotoxicity receptors. These alterations can be responsible of the decreased production of cytokines and the lower per-cell cytotoxicity observed in the elderly. Considering the relevance of these cells in the initiation of the immune response, the possibility to reactivate the function of innate immune cells should be considered in order to improve the response to pathogens and to vaccination in the elderly.},

Whether there is a functional relationship between the proneural phenotype and the associated genetic alterations is unknown. To evaluate this possible relationship, we performed a longitudinal molecular characterization of tumor progression in a mouse model of proneural glioma. In this setting, the tumors acquired remarkably consistent genetic deletions at late stages of progression, similar to those deleted in human proneural glioblastoma. Further investigations revealed that p53 is a master regulator of the transcriptional network underlying the proneural phenotype. This p53-centric transcriptional network and its associated phenotype were observed at both the early and late stages of progression, and preceded the proneural-specific deletions. Remarkably, deletion of p53 at the time of tumor initiation obviated the acquisition of later deletions, establishing a link between the proneural transcriptional network and the subtype-specific deletions selected during glioma progression.

  abstract = {High-throughput sequencing of cDNA (RNA-seq) is used extensively to characterize the transcriptome of cells. Many transcriptomic studies aim at comparing either abundance levels or the transcriptome composition between given conditions, and as a first step, the sequencing reads must be used as the basis for abundance quantification of transcriptomic features of interest, such as genes or transcripts. Various quantification approaches have been proposed, ranging from simple counting of reads that overlap given genomic regions to more complex estimation of underlying transcript abundances. In this paper, we show that gene-level abundance estimates and statistical inference offer advantages over transcript-level analyses, in terms of performance and interpretability. We also illustrate that the presence of differential isoform usage can lead to inflated false discovery rates in differential gene expression analyses on simple count matrices but that\&nbsp;this can be addressed by incorporating offsets derived from transcript-level abundance estimates. We also show that the problem is relatively minor in several real data sets. Finally, we provide an R package ( tximport ) to help users integrate transcript-level abundance estimates from common quantification pipelines into count-based statistical inference engines.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION Identification of active gene regulatory elements is a key to understanding transcriptional control governing biological processes such as cell-type specificity, differentiation, development, proliferation, and response to the environment. Mapping DNase I hypersensitive (HS) sites has historically been a valuable tool for identifying all different types of regulatory elements, including promoters, enhancers, silencers, insulators, and locus control regions. This method utilizes DNase I to selectively digest nucleosome-depleted DNA (presumably by transcription factors), whereas DNA regions tightly wrapped in nucleosome and higher-order structures are more resistant. The traditional low-throughput method for identifying DNase I HS sites uses Southern blots. Here, we describe the complete and improved protocol for DNase-seq, a high-throughput method that identifies DNase I HS sites across the whole genome by capturing DNase-digested fragments and sequencing them by high-throughput, next-generation sequencing. In a single experiment, DNase-seq can identify most active regulatory regions from potentially any cell type, from any species with a sequenced genome.},

  abstract = {Summary Tumor cells metastasize to distant organs through genetic and epigenetic alterations, including changes in microRNA (miR) expression. Here we find miR-22 triggers epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), enhances invasiveness and promotes metastasis in~mouse xenografts. In a conditional mammary gland-specific transgenic (TG) mouse model, we show that miR-22 enhances mammary gland side-branching, expands the stem cell compartment, and promotes tumor development. Critically, miR-22 promotes aggressive metastatic disease in MMTV-miR-22 TG mice, as well as compound MMTV-neu or -PyVT-miR-22 TG mice. We demonstrate that miR-22 exerts its metastatic potential by silencing antimetastatic miR-200 through direct targeting of the TET (Ten eleven translocation) family of methylcytosine dioxygenases, thereby inhibiting demethylation of the mir-200 promoter. Finally, we show that miR-22 overexpression correlates with poor clinical outcomes and silencing of the TET-miR-200 axis in patients. Taken together, our findings implicate miR-22 as a crucial epigenetic modifier and promoter~of EMT and breast cancer stemness toward metastasis.},

We now report that binding of a physiological ligand, dimeric IgA, to pIgR stimulates pIgR transcytosis. This stimulation occurs in both the presence or absence of Ser-664 phosphorylation. We have used three methods to measure transcytosis of the pIgR. (s) The pIgR was biosyntheticaHly labeled and its cleavage to secretory component after transcytosis was measured. (ii) The pIgR was labeled with biotin at the basolateral surface. After transcytosis, release ofthe biotin-labeled secretory component into the apical medium was measured. (iii) Transcytosis of a ligand bound to the pIgR was measured. All three methods indicated that dimeric IgA stimulates transcytosis of the pIgR.},

PU.1, an ETS-family transcription factor, is essential for coordination of early B cell maturation and immunoglobulin gene (Ig) rearrangement. Here we show that RAG DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) generated during Ig light chain gene (Igl) rearrangement in pre-B cells induce global changes in PU.1 chromatin binding. RAG DSBs activate a SPIC/BCLAF1 transcription factor complex that displaces PU.1 throughout the genome and regulates broad transcriptional changes. SPIC recruits BCLAF1 to gene-regulatory elements that control expression of key B cell developmental genes. The SPIC/BCLAF1 complex suppresses expression of the SYK tyrosine kinase and enforces the transition from large to small pre-B cells. These studies reveal that RAG DSBs direct genome-wide changes in ETS transcription factor activity to promote early B cell development.},

  abstract = {Genetic programming for self-renewal Instead of repopulating themselves from tissue-resident stem cell pools like most types of differentiated cells, tissue macrophages maintain themselves by self-renewing. The underlying genetic programs that allow for this, however, are unknown. Soucie et al. now report that in macrophages at homeostasis, a pair of transcription factors (MafB and c-Maf) bind to and repress the enhancers of genes regulating self-renewal. When macrophages need to replenish their stocks, for example in response to injury, they transiently decrease MafB and c-Maf expression so they can self-renew. A parallel pathway also operates to control the self-renewal of embryonic stem cells. Science, this issue p. 10.1126/science.aad5510 Structured Abstract INTRODUCTIONIn many organs of the body, differentiated cells are frequently lost and need to be replaced as part of normal homeostatic tissue maintenance or in response to injury. In most cases, this regeneration is assured by differentiation from tissue-specific stem cells. Together with a few other cell types, tissue macrophages represent a rare exception to this pathway, as they can be maintained independently of blood stem cells by local proliferation. Under certain conditions, mature macrophages can also be expanded and maintained long term in culture without transformation or loss of differentiation status. The gene regulatory mechanisms that allow such differentiated cells to self-renew while maintaining cell type–specific identity have so far remained unknown. Self-renewing macrophages provide a rare opportunity to study this question. RATIONALEMolecularly, cell identity can be defined by the genomic positions of gene regulatory enhancer elements. The cell type–specific signatures and activity status of such elements have been characterized by the analysis of specific histone modifications and the binding of regulatory proteins. To identify the regulatory mechanisms that enable macrophage self-renewal capacity to be integrated into the overall program of epigenetic macrophage identity, we have compared the enhancer repertoires of quiescent and self-renewing macrophages. Based on our previous observations that deletion of MafB and c-Maf transcription factors results in an extended self-renewal capacity of macrophages, we further investigated how the absence of Maf transcription factors affects the enhancers of specific self-renewal genes and how these mechanisms activate macrophage self-renewal under homeostatic and challenge conditions in vivo. RESULTSCompared to quiescent macrophages, self-renewing macrophages showed no appreciable difference with respect to genome-wide enhancer positions but displayed an increase in the activation status of many enhancers that were also bound by the lineage-specifying transcription factor PU.1 in both cell types. This finding suggests that these poised macrophage-specific enhancers became active in self-renewing macrophages. We found activated enhancers to be associated with a network of genes, centered on Myc and Klf2, that were up-regulated and functionally important for self-renewal in these cells. The same genes were also required for embryonic stem (ES) cell self-renewal but were associated with a distinct, ES cell–specific set of enhancers. We observed that activated self-renewal–associated macrophage enhancers were directly repressed by MafB binding. The loss of MafB and c-Maf expression relieved this repression and led to activation of the self-renewal gene network in MafB and cMaf knockout macrophages, as well as in alveolar macrophages that express constitutively low levels of these transcription factors. In vivo single-cell analysis further revealed that, both in the steady state and in response to immune stimulation, proliferating resident macrophages could access this network by transient down-regulation of Maf transcription factors. CONCLUSIONOur results demonstrate that self-renewal in macrophages involves down-regulation of MafB and cMaf, as well as concomitant activation of a self-renewal gene network shared with ES cells but controlled from cell type–specific enhancers. Macrophage enhancers associated with self-renewal genes are already present in quiescent cells and can become activated when direct repression by Maf transcription factors is relieved. Our findings provide a general molecular rationale for the compatibility of self-renewal and differentiated cell functions and may also be more generally relevant for the direct activation of self-renewal activity in other differentiated cell types with therapeutic potential.

Based on the experiences of mandatory cell line authentication at the International Journal of Cancer (IJC), we provide an overview of the issues pertinent to misidentified cell lines and discuss available solutions. We also summarize the lessons learned, revealing that at least 5\% of the human cell lines used in manuscripts considered for peer review are misidentified. About 4\% of the considered manuscripts are rejected for severe cell line problems, and most are subsequently published in other journals. In order to diminish such malpractice and its consequences for the scientific record, we postulate that strict multi‐layered quality control is essential. Besides journals and publishers, we encourage scientists, research institutions, and funders to take action on the matter and revise their respective policies. Hence, we provide concrete recommendations on introducing regular authentication schemes and staff training, and discuss future steps for enhancing good cell culture practices.},

  abstract = {Cancers are characterized by genomic instability, and the resulting intraclonal diversity is a prerequisite for tumor evolution. Therefore, metrics of tumor heterogeneity may prove to be clinically meaningful. Intraclonal heterogeneity in follicular lymphoma (FL) is apparent from studies of somatic hypermutation (SHM) caused by activation-induced deaminase (AID) in IGH. Aberrant SHM (aSHM), defined as AID activity outside of the IG loci, predominantly targets noncoding regions causing numerous "passenger" mutations, but it has the potential to generate rare significant "driver" mutations. The quantitative relationship between SHM and aSHM has not been defined. To measure SHM and aSHM, ultradeep sequencing ({$>$}20,000-fold coverage) was performed on IGH (\textasciitilde 1650 nt) and nine other noncoding regions potentially targeted by AID (combined 9411 nt), including the 5' untranslated region of BCL2. Single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) were found in 12/12 FL specimens (median 136 SHMs and 53 aSHMs). The aSHM SNVs were associated with AID motifs (p {$<$} 0.0001). The number of SNVs at BCL2 varied widely among specimens and correlated with the number of SNVs at eight other potential aSHM sites. In contrast, SHM at IGH was not predictive of aSHM. Tumor heterogeneity is apparent from SNVs at low variant allele frequencies; the relative number of SNVs with variable allele frequency {$<$} 5\% varied with clinical grade, indicating that tumor heterogeneity based on aSHM reflects a clinically meaningful parameter. These data suggest that genome-wide aSHM may be estimated from aSHM of BCL2 but not SHM of IGH. The results demonstrate a practical approach to the quantification of intratumoral genetic heterogeneity for clinical specimens.},

  abstract = {A recurrent somatic mutation frequently found in cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is internal tandem duplication (ITD) in the fms-related tyrosine kinase 3 gene (FLT3). This mutation is generally detected in the clinical laboratory by PCR and electrophoresis-based product sizing. As the number of clinically relevant somatic mutations in AML increases, it becomes increasingly attractive to incorporate FLT3 ITD testing into multiplex assays for many somatic mutations simultaneously, using next-generation sequencing (NGS). However, the performance of most NGS analysis tools for identifying medium-size insertions such as FLT3 ITD mutations is largely unknown. We used a multigene, targeted NGS assay to obtain deep sequence coverage ({$>$}1000-fold) of FLT3 and 26 other genes from 22 FLT3 ITD-positive and 29 ITD-negative specimens to examine the performance of several commonly used NGS analysis tools for identifying FLT3 ITD mutations. ITD mutations were present in hybridization-capture sequencing data, and Pindel was the only tool out of the seven tested that reliably detected these insertions. Pindel had 100\% sensitivity (95\% CI = 83\% to 100\%) and 100\% specificity (95\% CI = 88\% to 100\%) in our samples; Pindel provided accurate ITD insertion sizes and was able to detect ITD alleles present at estimated frequencies as low as 1\%. These data demonstrate that FLT3 ITDs can be reliably detected in panel-based, next-generation sequencing assays.},

They act as either transcriptional activators or repressors and can be proto-oncogenes or tumour suppressors. Understanding their regulation and interaction may explain how RUNX factors contribute to such different and often opposing biological processes. We show that RUNX3 regulates RUNX1 expression, contributing to the mutually exclusive expression of RUNX3 and RUNX1 in human B lymphoid cell lines. RUNX3 repressed the RUNX1 P1 promoter by binding specifically to conserved RUNX sites near the transcription start of the promoter. siRNA inhibition of RUNX3 in lymphoblastoid cells resulted in increased RUNX1 expression, indicating that continuous expression of physiological levels of RUNX3 is required to maintain repression. Furthermore, expression of RUNX3 was required for efficient proliferation of B cells immortalized by Epstein–Barr virus. Cross-regulation between different RUNX family members is therefore a means of controlling RUNX protein expression and must now be considered in the interpretation of pathological changes due to loss of RUNX3 tumour suppressor function or following gene duplication or translocation events.},

Here, we introduce Binless, a resolution-agnostic method that adapts to the quality and quantity of available data, to detect both interactions and differences. Binless relies on an alternate representation of Hi-C data, which leads to a more detailed classification of paired-end reads. Using a large-scale benchmark, we demonstrate that Binless is able to call interactions with higher reproducibility than other existing methods. Binless, which is freely available, can thus reliably be used to identify chromatin loops as well as for differential analysis of chromatin interaction maps.},

In liquid culture MEC1 cells grow adherent to the vessel wall and as tiny clumps; MEC2 cells do not adhere and form large clumps. The doubling time of MEC1 is 40h and of MEC2 is 31h. Both cell lines express the same light (κ) and heavy chains (μ, δ) as the fresh parental B-CLL cells at the same high intensity, share the expression of mature B cell markers (CD19,CD20, CD21, CD22), differ in the expression of CD23 and FMC7, are CD11a+, CD18+, CD44+, CD49d+, CD54+ and express at high levels both CD80 and CD86. CD5 is negative on MEC1 cells (as on the vast majority of parental cells) and it has been lost by MEC2 cells after several months of culture. The cells have a complex karyotype. The tumour origin of MEC1 and MEC2 has been demonstrated by Southern blot analysis of the IgH loci and by Ig gene DNA sequencing.

In contrast to other normalization techniques, it properly handles the Hi-C-specific decay of chromatin interaction frequencies with the increasing distance between interacting regions. multiHiCcompare uses the general linear model framework for comparative analysis of multiple Hi-C datasets, adapted for the Hi-C-specific decay of chromatin interaction frequencies. multiHiCcompare outperforms other methods when detecting a priori known chromatin interaction differences from jointly normalized datasets. Applied to the analysis of auxin-treated versus~untreated experiments, and CTCF depletion experiments, multiHiCcompare was able to recover the expected epigenetic and gene expression signatures of loss of chromatin interactions and reveal novel insights.multiHiCcompare is freely available on GitHub and as a Bioconductor R package https://bioconductor.org/packages/multiHiCcompare.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

  abstract = {How cells keep going in the face of adversity When cells experience stresses that affect their ability to process newly synthesized proteins, they turn down their rates of translation to help them survive the stress. They also turn on the translation of proteins that will help them cope with the misfolded proteins generated during stress. How do they turn down translation in general, but maintain or increase translation of specific proteins? Starck et al. developed an approach that allowed them to look at the translation of specific messenger RNAs that were not down-regulated by stress. They identified a motif that helped keep chaperone protein synthesis going. Science, this issue p. 10.1126/science.aad2197 Structured Abstract INTRODUCTIONProtein synthesis is controlled by a plethora of developmental and environmental conditions. One intracellular signaling network, the integrated stress response (ISR), activates one of four kinases in response to a variety of distinct stress stimuli: the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)–resident kinase (PERK), the interferon-induced double-stranded RNA–dependent eIF2α kinase (PKR), the general control nonderepressible 2 (GCN2), or the heme-regulated inhibitor kinase (HRI). These four kinases recognize a central target and phosphorylate a single residue, Ser51, on the α subunit of the eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2α), which is a component of the trimeric initiation factor eIF2 that catalyzes translation initiation at AUG start codons. Phosphorylation of eIF2α down-regulates eIF2-dependent protein synthesis, which is important in development and immunity but also is implicated in neurodegeneration, cancer, and autoimmunity. However, protein synthesis does not cease on all mRNAs during the ISR. Rather, eIF2α phosphorylation is required for expression of select mRNAs, such as ATF4 and CHOP, that harbor small upstream open reading frames (uORFs) in their 5′ untranslated regions (5′ UTRs). Still other mRNAs sustain translation despite ISR activation. We developed tracing translation by T cells (3T) as an exquisitely sensitive technique to probe the translational dynamics of uORFs directly during the ISR. With 3T, we measured the peptide products of uORFs present in the 5′ UTR of the essential ER-resident chaperone, binding immunoglobulin protein (BiP), also known as heat shock protein family A member 5 (HSPA5), and characterized their requirement for BiP expression during the ISR. RATIONALEWe repurposed the sensitivity and specificity of T cells to interrogate the translational capacity of RNA outside of annotated protein coding sequences (CDSs). 3T relies on insertion of a tracer peptide coding sequence into a candidate DNA sequence. The resulting mRNAs harboring the nested tracer peptide coding sequence are translated to produce tracer peptides. These translation products are processed and loaded onto major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC I) molecules in the ER and transit to the cell surface, where they can be detected by specific T cell hybridomas that are activated and quantified using a colorimetric reagent. 3T provides an approach to interrogate the thousands of predicted uORFs in mammalian genomes, characterize the importance of uORF biology for regulation, and generate fundamental insights into uORF mutation-based diseases. RESULTS3T proved to be a sensitive and robust indicator of uORF expression. We measured uORF expression in the 5′ UTR of mRNAs at multiple distinct regions, while simultaneously detecting expression of the CDS. We directly measured uORF peptide expression from ATF4 mRNA and showed that its translation persisted during the ISR. We applied 3T to study BiP expression, an ER chaperone stably synthesized during the ISR. We showed that the BiP 5′ UTR harbors uORFs that are exclusively initiated by UUG and CUG start codons. BiP uORF expression bypassed a requirement for eIF2 and was dependent on the alternative initiation factor eIF2A. Both translation of the UUG-initiated uORF and eIF2A were necessary for BiP expression during the ISR. Unexpectedly, the products of uORF translation are predicted to generate MHC I peptides active in adaptive immunity. We propose that this phenomenon presents an extracellular signature during the ISR. CONCLUSIONOur findings introduce the notion that cells harbor a distinct translation initiation pathway to respond to a variety of environmental conditions and cellular dysfunction. We showed that cells utilize a distinct, eIF2A-mediated initiation pathway, which includes uORF translation, to sustain expression of particular proteins during the ISR. 3T offers a valuable method to characterize the thousands of predicted translation events in 5′ UTRs and other noncoding RNAs and, expanded to a genome-wide scale, can complement ribosome profiling and mass spectrometry in uORF and short ORF discovery. Our observations underscore the importance of translation outside of annotated CDSs and challenge the very definition of the U in 5′ UTR.

When translated, they generate peptides that are transported into the ER, loaded onto MHC I, and transit to the cell surface. T cell hybridomas that recognize the specific tracer peptide–MHC I complex become activated, which is detected using a colorimetric substrate. Translated regions distinct from annotated coding sequences have emerged as essential elements of the proteome. This includes upstream open reading frames (uORFs) present in mRNAs controlled by the integrated stress response (ISR) that show “privileged” translation despite inhibited eukaryotic initiation factor 2–guanosine triphosphate–initiator methionyl transfer RNA (eIF2·GTP·Met-tRNAiMet). We developed tracing translation by T cells to directly measure the translation products of uORFs during the ISR. We identified signature translation events from uORFs in the 5′ untranslated region of binding immunoglobulin protein (BiP) mRNA (also called heat shock 70-kilodalton protein 5 mRNA) that were not initiated at the start codon AUG. BiP expression during the ISR required both the alternative initiation factor eIF2A and non–AUG-initiated uORFs. We propose that persistent uORF translation, for a variety of chaperones, shelters select mRNAs from the ISR, while simultaneously generating peptides that could serve as major histocompatibility complex class I ligands, marking cells for recognition by the adaptive immune system. Protein translation from open reading frames with alternative initiation codons occurs during induction of cellular stress responses. Protein translation from open reading frames with alternative initiation codons occurs during induction of cellular stress responses.},

  abstract = {ChIP-seq has become a widely adopted genomic assay in recent years to determine binding sites for transcription factors or enrichments for specific histone modifications. Beside detection of enriched or bound regions, an important question is to determine differences between conditions. While this is a common analysis for gene expression, for which a large number of computational approaches have been validated, the same question for ChIP-seq is particularly challenging owing to the complexity of ChIP-seq data in terms of noisiness and variability. Many different tools have been developed and published in recent years. However, a comprehensive comparison and review of these tools is still missing. Here, we have reviewed 14 tools, which have been developed to determine differential enrichment between two conditions. They differ in their algorithmic setups, and also in the range of applicability. Hence, we have benchmarked these tools on real data sets for transcription factors and histone modifications, as well as on simulated data sets to quantitatively evaluate their performance. Overall, there is a great variety in the type of signal detected by these tools with a surprisingly low level of agreement. Depending on the type of analysis performed, the choice of method will crucially impact the outcome.},

  abstract = {Summary Protein-protein interaction maps provide a valuable framework for a better understanding of the functional organization of the proteome. To detect interacting pairs of human proteins systematically, a protein matrix of 4456 baits and 5632 preys was screened by automated yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) interaction mating. We identified 3186 mostly novel interactions among 1705 proteins, resulting in a large, highly connected network. Independent pull-down and coimmunoprecipitation assays validated the overall quality of the Y2H interactions. Using topological and GO criteria, a scoring system was developed to define 911 high-confidence interactions among 401 proteins. Furthermore, the network was searched for interactions linking uncharacterized gene products and human disease proteins to regulatory cellular pathways. Two novel Axin-1 interactions were validated experimentally, characterizing ANP32A and CRMP1 as modulators of Wnt signaling. Systematic human protein interaction screens can lead to a more comprehensive understanding of protein function and cellular processes.},

We show that both binding and cleavage of DNA by Cas9:RNA require recognition of a short trinucleotide protospacer adjacent motif (PAM). Non-target DNA binding affinity scales with PAM density, and sequences fully complementary to the guide RNA but lacking a nearby PAM are ignored by Cas9:RNA. DNA strand separation and RNA:DNA heteroduplex formation initiate at the PAM and proceed directionally towards the distal end of the target sequence. Furthermore, PAM interactions trigger Cas9 catalytic activity. These results reveal how Cas9 employs PAM recognition to quickly identify potential target sites while scanning large DNA molecules, and to regulate dsDNA scission.},

The technique enables genome folding to be examined at a scale of less than 100 kb, and chromosome structures to be validated. The structures of individual topological-associated domains and loops vary substantially from cell to cell. By contrast, A and B compartments, lamina-associated domains and active enhancers and promoters are organized in a consistent way on a genome-wide basis in every cell, suggesting that they could drive chromosome and genome folding. By studying genes regulated by pluripotency factor and nucleosome remodelling deacetylase (NuRD), we illustrate how the determination of single-cell genome structure provides a new approach for investigating biological processes.},

  abstract = {Hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α (HNF4α) plays a critical role in regulating the expression of many genes essential for normal functioning of liver, gut, kidney, and pancreatic islets. A nonsense mutation (Q268X) in exon 7 of the HNF4α gene is responsible for an autosomal dominant, early-onset form of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (maturity-onset diabetes of the young; gene named MODY1). Although this mutation is predicted to delete 187 C-terminal amino acids of the HNF4α protein the molecular mechanism by which it causes diabetes is unknown. To address this, we first studied the functional properties of the MODY1 mutant protein. We show that it has lost its transcriptional transactivation activity, fails to dimerize and bind DNA, implying that the MODY1 phenotype is because of a loss of HNF4α function. The effect of loss of function on HNF4α target gene expression was investigated further in embryonic stem cells, which are amenable to genetic manipulation and can be induced to form visceral endoderm. Because the visceral endoderm shares many properties with the liver and pancreatic β-cells, including expression of genes for glucose transport and metabolism, it offers an ideal system to investigate HNF4-dependent gene regulation in glucose homeostasis. By exploiting this system we have identified several genes encoding components of the glucose-dependent insulin secretion pathway whose expression is dependent upon HNF4α. These include glucose transporter 2, and the glycolytic enzymes aldolase B and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and liver pyruvate kinase. In addition we have found that expression of the fatty acid binding proteins and cellular retinol binding protein also are down-regulated in the absence of HNF4α. These data provide direct evidence that HNF4α is critical for regulating glucose transport and glycolysis and in doing so is crucial for maintaining glucose homeostasis.},

One multiple hypothesis testing error measure is the false discovery rate (FDR), which is loosely defined to be the expected proportion of false positives among all significant hypotheses. The FDR is especially appropriate for exploratory analyses in which one is interested in finding several significant results among many tests. In this work, we introduce a modified version of the FDR called the "positive false discovery rate" (pFDR). We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the pFDR and investigate its statistical properties. When assuming the test statistics follow a mixture distribution, we show that the pFDR can be written as a Bayesian posterior probability and can be connected to classification theory. These properties remain asymptotically true under fairly general conditions, even under certain forms of dependence. Also, a new quantity called the "q -value" is introduced and investigated, which is a natural "Bayesian posterior p-value," or rather the pFDR analogue of the p-value.}

Mesothelioma is classified into three main histological subtypes: epithelioid, sarcomatoid and biphasic. Although the pathological diagnostic markers for epithelioid are established, to date no adequate marker for sarcomatoid mesothelioma has been found. Thus, a reliable diagnostic marker of sarcomatoid mesothelioma is necessary. In this study, to identify an unknown protein with 120 kDa expressed only in the mesothelioma cell line 211H, we conducted proteomic analysis and found five candidate proteins. One such protein, AHNAK, was highly expressed in all seven mesothelioma cell lines (211H, H28, H226, H2052, H2452, MESO1 and MESO4), but not in the mesothelial cell line MeT-5A by RT-PCR and immunofluorescence staining. Furthermore, we confirmed high AHNAK expression not only in xenografts but also in human mesothelioma specimens including sarcomatoid, epithelioid and biphasic mesothelioma using immunohistochemical staining. These findings suggest that AHNAK has the potential to be a new marker for detecting mesothelioma. Since AHNAK is involved in cell migration and invasion in other metastatic tumor cells, we conducted migration and invasion assays in mesothelioma cell lines. The number of migrating cells in six of seven mesothelioma cell lines and the number of invading cells in all seven cell lines were significantly increased compared with those in MeT-5A. Knockdown of AHNAK significantly reduced the cell migration and invasion ability in all seven mesothelioma cell lines. These results support further clinical evaluation of the association of AHNAK and metastasis in mesothelioma.},

We show that the proteoglycan NG2 segregates asymmetrically during mitosis to generate OPC cells of distinct fate. NG2 is required for asymmetric segregation of EGFR to the NG2+ progeny, which consequently activates EGFR and undergoes EGF-dependent proliferation and self-renewal. In contrast, the NG2− progeny differentiates. In a mouse model, decreased NG2 asymmetry coincides with premalignant, abnormal self-renewal rather than differentiation and with tumor-initiating potential. Asymmetric division of human NG2+ cells is prevalent in non-neoplastic tissue but is decreased in oligodendrogliomas. Regulators of asymmetric cell division are misexpressed in low-grade oligodendrogliomas. Our results identify loss of asymmetric division associated with the neoplastic transformation of OPC.},

Binding of pIgA to pIgR stimulates transcytosis in a process requiring Yes, a Src family tyrosine kinase (SFK). We show that Yes directly phosphorylates EGF receptor (EGFR) on liver endosomes. Injection of pIgA into rats induced EGFR phosphorylation. Similarly, in MDCK cells, pIgA treatment significantly increased phosphorylation of EGFR on various sites, subsequently activating extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK). Furthermore, we find that the Rab11 effector Rab11-FIP5 is a substrate of ERK. Knocking down Yes or Rab11-FIP5, or inhibition of the Yes-EGFR-ERK cascade, decreased pIgA-pIgR transcytosis. Finally, we demonstrate that Rab11-FIP5 phosphorylation by ERK controls Rab11a endosome distribution and pIgA-pIgR transcytosis.

  abstract = {Summary To investigate the cell-intrinsic aging mechanisms that erode the function of somatic stem cells during aging, we have conducted a comprehensive integrated genomic analysis of young and aged cells. We profiled the transcriptome, DNA methylome, and histone modifications of young and old murine hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Transcriptome analysis indicated reduced TGF-β signaling and perturbation of genes involved in HSC proliferation and differentiation. Aged HSCs exhibited broader H3K4me3 peaks across HSC identity and self-renewal genes and showed increased DNA methylation at transcription factor binding sites associated with differentiation-promoting genes combined with a reduction at genes associated with HSC maintenance. Altogether, these changes reinforce HSC self-renewal and diminish differentiation, paralleling phenotypic HSC aging behavior. Ribosomal biogenesis emerged as a particular target of aging with increased transcription of ribosomal protein and RNA genes and hypomethylation of rRNA genes. This data set will serve as a reference for future epigenomic analysis of stem cell aging.},

Here we identify upstream activators and downstream effectors of TET1 in breast cancer using human breast cancer cells and a genetically engineered mouse model. We show that depleting the architectural transcription factor high mobility group AT-hook 2 (HMGA2) induces TET1. TET1 binds and demethylates its own promoter and the promoter of homeobox A (HOXA) genes, enhancing its own expression and stimulating expression of HOXA genes including HOXA7 and HOXA9. Both TET1 and HOXA9 suppress breast tumor growth and metastasis in mouse xenografts. The genes comprising the HMGA2–TET1–HOXA9 pathway are coordinately regulated in breast cancer and together encompass a prognostic signature for patient survival. These results implicate the HMGA2–TET1–HOX signaling pathway in the epigenetic regulation of human breast cancer and highlight the importance of targeting methylation in specific subpopulations as a potential therapeutic strategy.},

However, the prognostic significance of lncRNAs in diffuse large-B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) remains unclear and needs to be systematically investigated. In this study, we obtained and analyzed lncRNA expression profiles in three cohorts of 1043 DLBCL patients by repurposing the publicly available microarray datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. In the discovery series of 207 patients, we identified a set of six lncRNAs that was significantly associated with patients’ overall survival (OS) using univariate Cox regression analysis. The six prognostic lncRNAs were combined to form an expression-based six-lncRNA signature which classified patients of the discovery series into the high-risk group and low-risk group with significantly different survival outcome (HR = 2.31, 95\% CI = 1.8 to 2.965, p {$<$} 0.001). The six-lncRNA signature was further confirmed in the internal testing series and two additional independent datasets with different array platform. Moreover, the prognostic value of the six-lncRNA signature is independent of conventional clinical factors. Functional analysis suggested that six-lncRNA signature may be involved with DLBCL through exerting their regulatory roles in known cancer-related pathways, immune system and signaling molecules interaction.},

In this regard, cancer testis antigens have emerged as a potential targets for developing novel clinical biomarkers and immunotherapy for various malignancies. These germ cell specific proteins exhibit aberrant expression in cancer cells and contribute in tumorigenesis. Owing to their unique expression profile and immunogenicity in cancer patients, cancer testis antigens are clinically referred as the most promising tumor associated antigens. Several cancer testis antigens have been studied in colorectal cancer but none of them could be used in clinical practice.

  abstract = {In diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), many oncogenic microRNAs (OncomiRs) are highly expressed to promote disease development and progression by inhibiting the expression and function of certain tumor suppressor genes, and these OncomiRs comprise a promising new class of molecular targets for the treatment of DLBCL. However, most current therapeutic studies have focused on a single miRNA, with limited treatment outcomes. In this study, we generated tandem sequences of 10 copies of the complementary binding sequences to 13 OncomiRs and synthesized an interfering long non-coding RNA (i-lncRNA). The highly-expressed i-lncRNA in DLBCL cells would compete with the corresponding mRNAs of OncomiR target genes for binding OncomiRs, thereby effectively consuming a large amount of OncomiRs and protecting many tumor suppressor genes. The in vitro experiments confirmed that the i-lncRNA expression significantly inhibited cell proliferation, induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in DLBCL cell lines, mainly through upregulating the expression of PTEN, p27kip1, TIMP3, RECK and downregulating the expression of p38/MAPK, survivin, CDK4, c-myc. In the established SUDHL-4 xenografts in nude mice, the treatment strategy involving adenovirus-mediated i-lncRNA expression significantly inhibited the growth of DLBCL xenografts. Therefore, this treatment would specifically target the carcinogenic effects of many OncomiRs that are usually expressed in DLBCL and not in normal cells, such a strategy could improve anti-tumor efficacy and safety and may be a good prospect for clinical applications.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}The more than 500 single-cell transcriptomics studies that have been published to date constitute a valuable and vast resource for biological discovery. While various “atlas” projects have collated some of the associated datasets, most questions related to specific tissue types, species, or other attributes of studies require identifying papers through manual and challenging literature search. To facilitate discovery with published single-cell transcriptomics data, we have assembled a near exhaustive, manually curated database of single-cell transcriptomics studies with key information: descriptions of the type of data and technologies used, along with descriptors of the biological systems studied. Additionally, the database contains summarized information about analysis in the papers, allowing for analysis of trends in the field. As an example, we show that the number of cell types identified in scRNA-seq studies is proportional to the number of cells analysed. The database is available at www.nxn.se/single-cell-studies/gui.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) in female lymphocytes is uniquely regulated, as the inactive X (Xi) chromosome lacks localized Xist RNA and heterochromatin modifications. Epigenetic profiling reveals that Xist RNA is lost from the Xi at the pro-B cell stage and that additional heterochromatic modifications are gradually lost during B cell development. Activation of mature B cells restores Xist RNA and heterochromatin to the Xi in a dynamic two-step process that differs in timing and pattern, depending on the method of B cell stimulation. Finally, we find that DNA binding domain of YY1 is necessary for XCI in activated B cells, as ex-vivo YY1 deletion results in loss of Xi heterochromatin marks and up-regulation of X-linked genes. Ectopic expression of the YY1 zinc finger domain is sufficient to restore Xist RNA localization during B cell activation. Together, our results indicate that Xist RNA localization is critical for maintaining XCI in female lymphocytes, and that chromatin changes on the Xi during B cell development and the dynamic nature of YY1-dependent XCI maintenance in mature B cells predisposes X-linked immunity genes to reactivation.},

General transcription factors (GTFs) have a central role in the regulation of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) function because they are involved in the initiation of transcription at all class II promoters. Recent studies have shown that GTFs and Pol II are recruited to enhancer elements and that this binding is an early event in gene activation. We propose that an important role of some enhancers is to function as nucleation centres for the assembly of the pre-initiation complex to regulate the timing of gene activation during development, differentiation and the cell cycle.},

The application of STR regions to population genetics and personal identification has been well studied. Recent technical advances have enabled us to analyze multilocus STR regions simultaneously by a method, called the STR Multiplex system, that uses a single PCR amplification in one tube. We established a new evaluation system for the identification of cell lines based on an STR Multiplex method that uses 9 different loci: D5S818, D13S317, D7S820, D16S539, vWA, TH01, Amelogenin, TPDX, and CSF1P0. The STR profiling data from 96 cell lines were examined and an efficiency of this approach for cell standardization was found. Using this method, we have analyzed the STR profiles of human cell lines, ECV304, EJ1, and 124, recently reported by the DSMZ-German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures to have been cross-contaminated. Our results clearly detect the cross-contamination between ECV304 and EJ-1/T24. The cross-contamination was estimated to be derived from the T24 cells. Collectively, the STR Multiplex system provides a rapid, precise, and powerful method in cell line identification for quality control at the JCRB Cell Bank.},

Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), members of the transforming growth factor-β family, induce differentiation of GICs and suppress their tumorigenicity. However, the mechanisms underlying the BMP-induced loss of GIC stemness have not been fully elucidated. Here, we show that paired related homeobox 1 (PRRX1) induced by BMPs decreases the CD133-positive GIC population and inhibits tumorigenic activity of GICs in vivo. Of the two splice isoforms of PRRX1, the longer isoform, pmx-1b, but not the shorter isoform, pmx-1a, induces GIC differentiation. Upon BMP stimulation, pmx-1b interacts with the DNA methyltransferase DNMT3A and induces promoter methylation of the PROM1 gene encoding CD133. Silencing DNMT3A maintains PROM1 expression and increases the CD133-positive GIC population. Thus, pmx-1b promotes loss of stem cell-like properties of GICs through region-specific epigenetic regulation of CD133 expression by recruiting DNMT3A, which is associated with decreased tumorigenicity of GICs.},

We applied an advanced ChIA-PET strategy to comprehensively map higher-order chromosome folding and specific chromatin interactions mediated by CTCF and RNAPII with haplotype specificity and nucleotide resolution in different human cell lineages. We find that CTCF/cohesin-mediated interaction anchors serve as structural foci for spatial organization of constitutive genes concordant with CTCF-motif orientation, whereas RNAPII interacts within these structures by selectively drawing cell-type-specific genes towards CTCF-foci for coordinated transcription. Furthermore, we show that haplotype-variants and allelic-interactions have differential effects on chromosome configuration influencing gene expression and may provide mechanistic insights into functions associated with disease susceptibility. 3D-genome simulation suggests a model of chromatin folding around chromosomal axes, where CTCF is involved in defining the interface between condensed and open compartments for structural regulation. Our 3D-genome strategy thus provides unique insights in the topological mechanism of human variations and diseases.},

  abstract = {During our life, we are surrounded by continuous threats from a diverse range of invading pathogens. Our immune system has evolved multiple mechanisms to efficiently deal with these threats so as to prevent them from causing disease. Terminal differentiation of mature B cells into plasma cells (PC) – the antibody (Ab) secreting cells of the immune system – is critical for the generation of protective and long-lived humoral immune responses. Indeed, efficient production of antigen (Ag)-specific Ab by activated B cells underlies the success of most currently available vaccines. The mature B-cell pool is composed of several subsets, distinguished from one according to size, surface marker expression, location, and Ag exposure, and they all have the capacity to differentiate into PCs. For a B-cell to acquire the capacity to produce Abs, it must undergo an extensive differentiation process driven by changes in gene expression. Two broad categories of Ags exist that cause B-cell activation and differentiation: T cell dependent (TD) or T cell independent (TI). In addition to the B-cell subset and nature of the Ag, it is important to consider the cytokine environment that can also influence how B-cell differentiation is achieved. Thus, while many cytokines can induce Ab-secretion by B cells after activation with mimics of TD and TI stimuli in vitro, they can have different efficacies and specificities, and can often preferentially induce production of one particular Ig isotype over another. Here, we will provide an overview of in vitro studies (mouse and human origin) that evaluated the role of different cytokines in inducing the differentiation of distinct B-cell subsets to the PC lineage. We will place particular emphasis on IL-21, which has emerged as the most potent inducer of terminal B-cell differentiation in humans. We will also focus on the role of IL-21 and defects in B-cell function and how these contribute to human immunopathologies such as primary immunodeficiencies and B-cell mediated autoimmune conditions.},

  abstract = {Summary We report the identification of 67 previously undescribed histone modifications, increasing the current number of known histone marks by about 70\%. We~further investigated one of the marks, lysine crotonylation (Kcr), confirming that it represents an evolutionarily-conserved histone posttranslational modification. The unique structure and genomic localization of histone Kcr suggest that it is mechanistically and functionally different from histone lysine acetylation (Kac). Specifically, in both human somatic and mouse male germ cell genomes, histone Kcr marks either active promoters or potential enhancers. In male germinal cells immediately following meiosis, Kcr is enriched on sex chromosomes and specifically marks testis-specific genes, including a significant proportion of X-linked genes that escape sex chromosome inactivation in haploid cells. These results therefore dramatically extend the~repertoire of histone PTM sites and designate Kcr as a specific mark of active sex chromosome-linked genes in postmeiotic male germ cells.},

Studies in this area promise to uncover how helper versus cytotoxic T cells differentiate, and, possibly, even how effector T cells give rise to subsets of long-lived memory T cells with specialized activation properties. In a more general sense, examination of these loci has provided a unique opportunity to study epigenetic regulation in vertebrate development. The CD4 locus remains the only vertebrate gene currently shown to undergo developmentally regulated epigenetic silencing, and as such, it presents an ideal system for analyzing how heterochromatin is established during developmental processes in higher eukaryotes.},

T-ALL has many similar pathophysiological features to acute myeloid leukemia, which has been extensively studied in the establishment of the cancer stem cell (CSC) theory, but the CSC concept in T-ALL is still debatable. Although leukemia-initiating cells (LICs), which can generate leukemia in a xenograft setting, have been found in both human T-ALL patients and animal models, the nature and origin of LICs are largely unknown. In this review, we discuss recent studies on LICs in T-ALL and the potential mechanisms of LIC emergence in this disease. We focus on the oncogenic transcription factors TAL1, LMO2 and NOTCH1 and highlight the significance of the transcriptional regulatory programs in normal hematopoietic stem cells and T-ALL.},

  abstract = {The consistent appearance of specific chromosomal translocations in human Burkitt lymphomas and murine plasmacytomas has suggested that these translocations might play a role in malignant transformation. Here we show that transformation of these cells is frequently accompanied by the somatic rearrangement of a cellular analogue of an avian retrovirus transforming gene, c-myc. Moreover, we map c-myc to human chromosome 8 band q24, the chromosomal segment involved in the reciprocal Burkitt translocations [t(8;14), t(8;22) and t(2;8)]. In two t(8;14) human Burkitt cell lines, c-myc appears to have been translocated directly into a DNA restriction fragment that also encodes the immunoglobulin mu chain gene. In the case of a specific cloned fragment of DNA derived from a mouse plasmacytoma, we demonstrate directly that c-myc has been translocated into the immunoglobulin alpha switch region. Our data provide a molecular basis for considering the role that specific translocations might play in malignant transformation.},

To explore the role of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in HL, we studied lncRNA expression patterns in normal B-cell subsets, HL cell lines, and tissues. Naive and memory B cells showed a highly similar lncRNA expression pattern, distinct from GC-B cells. Significant differential expression between HL and normal GC-B cells was observed for 475 lncRNA loci. For two validated lncRNAs, an enhanced expression was observed in HL, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, and lymphoblastoid cell lines. For a third lncRNA, increased expression levels were observed in HL and part of Burkitt lymphoma cell lines. RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization on primary HL tissues revealed a tumor cell–specific expression pattern for all three lncRNAs. A potential cis-regulatory role was observed for 107 differentially expressed lncRNA-mRNA pairs localizing within a 60-kb region. Consistent with a cis-acting role, we showed a preferential nuclear localization for two selected candidates. Thus, we showed dynamic lncRNA expression changes during the transit of normal B cells through the GC reaction and widely deregulated lncRNA expression patterns in HL. Three lncRNAs showed a tumor cell–specific expression pattern in HL tissues and might therefore be of value as a biomarker.},

Nevertheless, the localization of these FL-like cells (FLLCs) in nonmalignant GC-rich tissues and the functional consequences of BCL2 overexpression have not been evaluated thus far. Among 85 reactive lymph node (RLN) samples, 14\% were found to contain high levels of t(14;18) by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. In t(14;18)hi RLNs, CD20posBCL2posCD10pos FLLCs consistently accumulated within the GC, essentially as nonproliferative CXCR4neg centrocytes. Moreover, they displayed a reduced response to proliferative stimuli in vitro. Altogether, our findings provide new insights into in situ FLLC functional properties and suggest that these cells have not acquired the ultimate genetic events leading to FL transformation.},

Chemo-immunotherapy is an established treatment modality for CLL patients, resulting in high rates of responses and improved survival, especially in low-risk CLL. New, alternative treatments target B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling and the Chemokine (C–X–C motif) Receptor 4 (CXCR4)–Chemokine (C–X–C motif) Ligand 12 (CXCL12) axis, which are key pathways of CLL-microenvironment cross talk. The remarkable clinical efficacy of inhibitors targeting the BCR-associated kinases Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta (PI3Kδ) challenges established therapeutic paradigms and corroborates the central role of BCR signaling in CLL pathogenesis. In this review, we discuss the cellular and molecular components of the CLL microenvironment. We also describe the emerging therapeutic options for CLL patients, with a focus on inhibitors of CXCR4–CXCL12 and BCR signaling.},

  abstract = {Summary Firefly luciferase (FLuc) is frequently used as~a reporter in high-throughput screening assays, owing to the exceptional sensitivity, dynamic range, and rapid measurement that bioluminescence affords. However, interaction of small molecules with FLuc has, to some extent, confounded its use in chemical biology and drug discovery. To identify and characterize chemotypes interacting with FLuc, we determined potency values for 360,864 compounds found in the NIH Molecular Libraries Small Molecule Repository, available in PubChem. FLuc inhibitory activity was observed for 12\% of this library with discernible SAR. Characterization of 151 inhibitors demonstrated a variety of inhibition modes, including FLuc-catalyzed formation of multisubstrate adduct enzyme inhibitor complexes. As in some cell-based~FLuc reporter assays, compounds acting as FLuc inhibitors yield paradoxical luminescence increases, thus data on compounds acquired from FLuc-dependent assays require careful analysis as described here.},

  abstract = {DNase I hypersensitive sites (DHSs) are markers of regulatory DNA and have underpinned the discovery of all classes of cis-regulatory elements including enhancers, promoters, insulators, silencers and locus control regions. Here we present the first extensive map of human DHSs identified through genome-wide profiling in 125 diverse cell and tissue types. We identify \textasciitilde 2.9 million DHSs that encompass virtually all known experimentally validated cis-regulatory sequences and expose a vast trove of novel elements, most with highly cell-selective regulation. Annotating these elements using ENCODE data reveals novel relationships between chromatin accessibility, transcription, DNA methylation and regulatory factor occupancy patterns. We connect \textasciitilde 580,000 distal DHSs with their target promoters, revealing systematic pairing of different classes of distal DHSs and specific promoter types. Patterning of chromatin accessibility at many regulatory regions is organized with dozens to hundreds of co-activated elements, and the transcellular DNase I sensitivity pattern at a given region can predict cell-type-specific functional behaviours. The DHS landscape shows signatures of recent functional evolutionary constraint. However, the DHS compartment in pluripotent and immortalized cells exhibits higher mutation rates than that in highly differentiated cells, exposing an unexpected link between chromatin accessibility, proliferative potential and patterns of human variation.},

  abstract = {Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a negative-sense single-stranded RNA virus responsible for lower respiratory tract infections. During infection, the presence of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) activates the interferon (IFN) regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) transcription factor, an event triggering expression of immediate early, IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). We examine the role of transcriptional elongation in control of IRF3-dependent ISG expression. RSV infection induces ISG54, ISG56, and CIG5 gene expression in an IRF3-dependent manner demonstrated by IRF3 small interfering RNA (siRNA) silencing in both A549 epithelial cells and IRF3−/− MEFs. ISG expression was mediated by the recruitment of IRF3, CDK9, polymerase II (Pol II), and phospho-Ser2 carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) Pol II to the IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE) binding sites of the IRF3-dependent ISG promoters in native chromatin. We find that RSV infection enhances the activated fraction of cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (CDK9) by promoting its association with bromodomain 4 (BRD4) and disrupting its association with the inhibitory 7SK small nuclear RNA. The requirement of CDK9 activity for ISG expression was shown by siRNA-mediated silencing of CDK9 and by a selective CDK9 inhibitor in A549 cells. In contrast, RSV-induced beta interferon (IFN-β) expression is not influenced by CDK9 inhibition. Using transcript-selective quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR (Q-RT-PCR) assays for the ISG54 gene, we observed that RSV induces transition from short to fully spliced mRNA transcripts and that this transition is blocked by CDK9 inhibition in both A549 and primary human small airway epithelial cells. These data indicate that transcription elongation plays a major role in RSV-induced ISG expression and is mediated by IRF3-dependent recruitment of activated CDK9. CDK9 activity may be a target for immunomodulation in RSV-induced lung disease.},

We found that in small cell B-cell lymphomas, EZH2 is expressed in {$<$}40\% of neoplastic cells, with heterogenous signal intensity. In aggressive B-cell lymphomas, 70–100\% of tumor cells were positive for EZH2 expression with high signal intensity, which correlated with a high proliferation rate. We investigated the potential signaling molecules that regulate EZH2 overexpression in aggressive B-cell lymphomas and found that 80\% of cases of EZH2-positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma show high p-ERK1/2 expression (average \textasciitilde 57\% tumor cell positivity). In contrast, only a small percentage of tumor cells (\textasciitilde 10\%) show p-ERK1/2 expression in Burkitt lymphoma and double hit lymphoma. On average, 91 and 76\% of neoplastic cells were positive for MYC expression in Burkitt lymphoma and double hit lymphoma, respectively, while only 20\% neoplastic cells were positive for MYC expression in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. None of the aggressive B-cell lymphomas showed significant p-STAT3 expression in EZH2-overexpressed cases. The correlation of EZH2 expression with aggressive behavior and proliferation rate in B-cell neoplasms suggests that this molecule may function as an oncogenic protein in these neoplasms, with possible regulation by different signaling cascades in different types of aggressive B-cell lymphomas: p-ERK-related signaling in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, and MYC-related signaling in Burkitt lymphoma and double hit lymphoma. Furthermore, EZH2 and associated signaling cascades may serve as therapeutic targets for the treatment of aggressive B-cell lymphomas.},

  abstract = {Chromatin immunoprecipitation and sequencing (ChIP-seq) has been widely used to map DNA-binding proteins, histone proteins and their modifications. ChIP-seq data contains redundant reads termed duplicates, referring to those mapping to the same genomic location and strand. There are two main sources of duplicates: polymerase chain reaction (PCR) duplicates and natural duplicates. Unlike natural duplicates that represent true signals from sequencing of independent DNA templates, PCR duplicates are artifacts originating from sequencing of identical copies amplified from the same DNA template. In analysis, duplicates are removed from peak calling and signal quantification. Nevertheless, a significant portion of the duplicates is believed to represent true signals. Obviously, removing all duplicates will underestimate the signal level in peaks and impact the identification of signal changes across samples. Therefore, an in-depth evaluation of the impact from duplicate removal is needed. Using eight public ChIP-seq datasets from three narrow-peak and two broad-peak marks, we tried to understand the distribution of duplicates in the genome, the extent by which duplicate removal impacts peak calling and signal estimation, and the factors associated with duplicate level in peaks. The three PCR-free histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) ChIP-seq data had about 40\% duplicates and 97\% of them were within peaks. For the other datasets generated with PCR amplification of ChIP DNA, as expected, the narrow-peak marks have a much higher proportion of duplicates than the broad-peak marks. We found that duplicates are enriched in peaks and largely represent true signals, more conspicuous in those with high confidence. Furthermore, duplicate level in peaks is strongly correlated with the target enrichment level estimated using nonredundant reads, which provides the basis to properly allocate duplicates between noise and signal. Our analysis supports the feasibility of retaining the portion of signal duplicates into downstream analysis, thus alleviating the limitation of complete deduplication.},

Stimulation of Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) by DNA is important in the activation of plasmacytoid dendritic cells and B cells. Here we show that HMGB1, a nuclear DNA-binding protein released from necrotic cells, was an essential component of DNA-containing immune complexes that stimulated cytokine production through a TLR9–MyD88 pathway involving the multivalent receptor RAGE. Moreover, binding of HMGB1 to class A CpG oligodeoxynucleotides considerably augmented cytokine production by means of TLR9 and RAGE. Our data demonstrate a mechanism by which HMGB1 and RAGE activate plasmacytoid dendritic cells and B cells in response to DNA and contribute to autoimmune pathogenesis.},

The development of methods for analysis of transcription factor interaction within native chromatin has been a significant advance for the systematic analyses of the timing of gene regulation and studies on the effects of chromatin modifying enzymes on promoter accessibility. Cross-linking-ChIP (XChIP) is a specific method involving formaldehyde mediated protein-chromatin fixation to preserve the interaction for subsequent target identification. However, the conventional single-step cross-linking technique does not preserve all protein-DNA interactions, especially for transcription factors in hyper-dynamic equilibrium with chromatin or for coactivator interactions. Here we describe a versatile, efficient “two-step” XChIP method that involves sequential protein-protein fixation followed by protein-DNA fixation. This method has been used successfully for analysis of chromatin binding for transcription factors (NF-κB, STAT3), polymerases (RNA Pol II), coactivators (CBP/p300, CDK9) and chromatin structural proteins (modified histones). Modifications of DNA extraction and sonication suitable for downstream target identification by quantitative genomic PCR and next generation sequencing are described.},

The percentage of Tregs did not differ significantly between patients and controls. Functional assays demonstrated a dichotomy in Treg function: in four out of 10 patients CD4+CD25+ T cells were incapable of suppressing autologous CD4+CD25- T-cell proliferation, whereas suppressive function was intact in the other six patients. Suppressive activity of Tregs inversely correlated with the peripheral blood tumor burden. T-plastin gene expression, used as a Sezary cell marker, confirmed that Sezary cells were heterogeneous for CD25 expression. Mixed lymphocyte reactions demonstrated that CD4+CD25- T cells from patients who lacked functional Tregs were susceptible to suppression by Tregs from healthy controls, and had not become suppressive themselves. Furthermore, we found reduced expression of Foxp3 in the CD4+CD25+ Tregs of these patients relative to the other six CTCL patients and controls. Our findings thus indicate a dysfunction of peripheral Tregs in certain CTCL patients, which correlates with tumor burden.},

The spatial organization of a 200 kb region spanning the murine β-globin locus was analyzed in expressing erythroid and nonexpressing brain tissue. In brain, the globin cluster adopts a seemingly linear conformation. In erythroid cells the hypersensitive sites of the locus control region (LCR), located 40–60 kb away from the active genes, come in close spatial proximity with these genes. The intervening chromatin with inactive globin genes loops out. Moreover, two distant hypersensitive regions participate in these interactions. We propose that clustering of regulatory elements is key to creating and maintaining active chromatin domains and regulating transcription.},

  abstract = {Background: The aims of our study were to identify serum biomarkers that distinguish pancreatic cancer (pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, PDAC) patients from benign pancreatic disease patients and healthy subjects, and to assess the effects of jaundice on biomarker performance. Methods: Isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification were used to compare pooled serum and pancreatic juice samples from a test set of 59 and 25 subjects, respectively. Validation was undertaken in 113 independent subjects. Results: Candidate proteins Complement C5, inter-α-trypsin inhibitor heavy chain H3, α1-β glycoprotein and polymeric immunoglobulin receptor were elevated in cancer, as were the reference markers CA19-9 and Reg3A. Biliary obstruction had a significant effect on the performance of the markers, in particular within the PDAC group where the presence of jaundice was associated with a significant increase in the levels of all six proteins (P{$<$}0.01). Consequently, in the absence of jaundice, proteins showed reduced sensitivity for PDAC patients over benign subjects and healthy controls (HCs). Similarly, in the presence of jaundice, markers showed reduced specificity for PDAC patients over benign subjects with jaundice. Combining markers enabled improved sensitivity for non-jaundiced PDAC patients over HCs and improved specificity for jaundiced PDAC patients over jaundiced benign disease subjects. Conclusions: The presence–absence of jaundice in the clinical scenario severely impacts the performance of biomarkers for PDAC diagnosis and has implications for their clinical translation.},

  abstract = {Structured Abstract INTRODUCTIONCancer arises from clonal expansion of a single cell. Yet, most human cancers are characterized by extensive intratumor heterogeneity and comprise various subpopulations of cells with distinct phenotypes and biological properties. Intratumor heterogeneity poses major challenges in understanding cancers, managing patients, and designing effective treatment strategies. Functional heterogeneity within individual tumors is partly due to the presence of genetically distinct subclonal cell populations. Furthermore, interactions between cancer cells and the tumor microenvironment can alter the phenotype of cancer cells via nongenetic mechanisms. The combination of cell-intrinsic and cell-extrinsic changes occurring during tumor growth generates functionally distinct subsets of cells that differentially contribute to tumor maintenance. RATIONALEIn many cancers, phenotypic and functional heterogeneity can be mapped to distinct differentiation states, suggesting that cellular hierarchies established during tumor growth may affect the long-term proliferative potential of cancer cells. To shed light on the mechanisms responsible for the generation of these hierarchies, we searched for epigenetic mechanisms that determine which cancer cells can preserve unlimited proliferative potential, and thus the ability to drive long-term tumor growth, and which cells lose this ability through a differentiation process. RESULTSWe found that, in several cancer types, individual tumors exhibit high heterogeneity of the major chromatin protein linker histone H1.0, showing strongly reduced H1.0 levels in cells characterized by long-term self-renewal ability and tumorigenic potential and higher levels in nontumorigenic cells. Combined analysis of pan-cancer patient data sets and experimental alteration of the H1F0 locus in tumor cells revealed that heterogeneous H1.0 expression patterns are partly due to differential methylation of an enhancer region that dynamically modulates H1.0 expression within tumors. Using a controlled system to model functional intratumor heterogeneity, we showed that maintenance of cell tumorigenic potential required silencing of H1.0 to avoid loss of unlimited proliferative capacity through differentiation. Mechanistically, absence of H1.0 led to destabilization of nucleosome-DNA interactions in AT-rich genomic regions and coordinated derepression of large sets of neighboring genes, resulting in activation of transcriptional programs that support cancer cell self-renewal. Gene expression changes induced by H1.0 loss were reversible, and epigenetic states restricting cell proliferative potential were reestablished upon H1.0 reexpression. In multiple cancer types, in agreement with the observed inhibition of cancer cell self-renewal by H1.0, patients expressing overall strongly reduced levels of H1.0 showed a significantly worse outcome than patients expressing higher H1.0 levels. CONCLUSIONIntratumor heterogeneity has emerged as a general feature of cancer, but the molecular features underlying functionally diverse cellular phenotypes have been elusive. Our results uncover epigenetic determinants of tumor-maintaining cells and identify an integral component of chromatin as an important regulator of cell differentiation states within tumors. We propose that only cells insensitive to extracellular differentiation cues, capable of permanently silencing H1.0, can act as self-renewing tumor-maintaining cells and that such a mechanism supports maintenance of several types of cancer. Our results suggest that intervention aimed at restoring high levels of H1.0 in all cancer cells may enhance the differentiation process that naturally occurs during tumor growth and may be beneficial for therapeutic purposes. Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Tumors comprise functionally diverse subpopulations of cells with distinct proliferative potential. Here, we show that dynamic epigenetic states defined by the linker histone H1.0 determine which cells within a tumor can sustain the long-term cancer growth. Numerous cancer types exhibit high inter- and intratumor heterogeneity of H1.0, with H1.0 levels correlating with tumor differentiation status, patient survival, and, at the single-cell level, cancer stem cell markers. Silencing of H1.0 promotes maintenance of self-renewing cells by inducing derepression of megabase-sized gene domains harboring downstream effectors of oncogenic pathways. Self-renewing epigenetic states are not stable, and reexpression of H1.0 in subsets of tumor cells establishes transcriptional programs that restrict cancer cells’ long-term proliferative potential and drive their differentiation. Our results uncover epigenetic determinants of tumor-maintaining cells.},

To gain insight into the molecular basis of Ebf1 function in early-stage B cells, we combined a genome-wide ChIP sequencing analysis with gain- and loss-of-function transcriptome analyses. Among 565 genes that are occupied and transcriptionally regulated by Ebf1, we identified large sets involved in (pre)-B cell receptor and Akt signaling, cell adhesion, and migration. Interestingly, a third of previously described Pax5 targets was found to be occupied by Ebf1. In addition to Ebf1-activated and -repressed genes, we identified targets at which Ebf1 induces chromatin changes that poise the genes for expression at subsequent stages of differentiation. Poised chromatin states on specific targets could also be established by Ebf1 expression in T~cells but not in NIH 3T3 cells, suggesting that Ebf1 acts as a “pioneer” factor in a hematopoietic chromatin context.},

The serine/arginine (SR) splicing factors regulate tissue- or cell-type-specific AS in a concentration- and phosphorylation-dependent manner. However, the mechanisms that modulate the cellular levels of active SR proteins remain to be elucidated. In the present study, we provide evidence for a role for the long nuclear-retained regulatory RNA (nrRNA), MALAT1 in AS regulation. MALAT1 interacts with SR proteins and influences the distribution of these and other splicing~factors in nuclear speckle domains. Depletion of MALAT1 or overexpression of an SR protein changes the AS of a similar set of endogenous pre-mRNAs. Furthermore, MALAT1 regulates cellular levels of phosphorylated forms of SR proteins. Taken together, our results suggest that MALAT1 regulates AS by modulating the levels of active SR proteins. Our results further highlight the role for an nrRNA in the regulation of gene expression.},

  abstract = {Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays were developed in order to comprehensively describe physiological interactions between DNA sequences, transcriptional regulators, and the modification status of associated chromatin. In ChIP assays, living cells are treated with chemical cross-linkers to covalently bind proteins to each other and to their DNA targets. Once cross-linked to associated proteins, chromatin is extracted and fragmented by sonication and protein-DNA complexes are isolated using specific antibodies against a target protein. The cross-links that bind proteins to DNA are then reversed, and purified DNA fragments are analyzed by qPCR to determine if a specific sequence is present. As DNA regulatory elements frequently rely on the interaction of multiple transcription factors and cofactors to regulate gene expression, Re-ChIP methods were developed to allow for the identification of multiple (concurrently binding) proteins on a single DNA sequence. Re-ChIP assays have enabled the analysis of multiple, simultaneous, posttranslational modifications to histones in order to determine the combinatorial pattern of modifications associated with transcriptional status of a gene. Together, ChIP and Re-ChIP have contributed to the elucidation of the epigenetic code-regulating gene expression and have enhanced our understanding of physiological binding of proteins to DNA targets. The protocols that follow describe general strategies used to perform ChIP and Re-ChIP assays for the study of specific protein-DNA interactions.},

The aim of this study was to determine the frequency, outcomes, and factors associated with other cancers in patients with CLL/SLL. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We reviewed the records of consecutive patients with previously untreated CLL/SLL seen at The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center from 1985 to 2005. The number of second cancers observed was compared with the number expected from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database. RESULTS: Among 2,028 patients, 324 (16\%) had a history of other cancers and 227 (11.2\%) developed other malignancies during the follow-up period. Overall, 625 cancers were observed in 551 patients, including skin (30\%), prostate (13\%), breast (9\%), melanoma (8\%), lymphoma (8\%), gastrointestinal (9\%), lung (6\%), and other cancers (17\%). The risk of a second cancer was 2.2 times higher than the expected risk. The response rates in patients with and without a history of other cancers were 86\% and 92\%, respectively (P = .04), and the 5-year survival rates were 70\% and 82\%, respectively (P {$<$} .001). In Cox analysis, independent factors predicting development of new cancers were older age, male sex, and elevated levels of beta2-microglobulin, lactate dehydrogenase, and creatinine. In patients who were treated for CLL/SLL, the treatment regimen did not affect the risk of subsequent cancer (P = .49). CONCLUSION: Patients with CLL/SLL have more than twice the risk of developing a second cancer and an increased frequency of certain cancer types. Awareness of risk factors could permit early detection.},

We show that this reporter responds to a variety of stimuli that are known to induce energy stress and that the response is dependent on AMPK α1 and α2 and on the upstream kinase LKB1. Interestingly, we found that AMPK activation is confined to the cytosol in response to energy stress but can be observed in both the cytosol and nucleus in response to calcium elevation. Finally, using this probe with U2OS cells in a microfluidic device, we observed a very high cell-to-cell variability in the amplitude and time course of AMPK activation and recovery in response to pulses of glucose deprivation.},

NURF is composed of at least four polypeptides that act in concert with the GAGA transcription factor to alter chromatin structure at the hsp70 promoter. The energy requirement is attributed to an ATPase activity that is stimulated by nucleosomes but not by free DNA or histones, suggesting that NURF acts directly on a nucleosome to perturb its structure. This finding and the physical properties of NURF contrast sharply with the multisubunit SWI2/SNF2 complex, which has also been shown to alter nucleosomes in an ATP-dependent manner. The results suggest that two distinct systems may be involved in remodeling chromatin for transcription.},

We identified a novel breakpoint region at 14q32.13 that was rearranged together with IGH/14q32.33 in four cases of BRAF/V600E-negative leukemia/lymphoma with villous lymphocytes carrying either t(14;14)(q32.13;q32.33) (three patients) or del(14)(q32.13q32.33) (one patient). The 14q32.13 breakpoints were mapped by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in the region harboring the TCL1A/TCL1B/TCL6 genes, known to be affected by TCRA/D-mediated t(14;14)(q11;q32)/inv(14)(q11q32) occurring in T-cell leukemia/lymphoma. To identify the target of t(14;14)(q32.13; q32.33) and del(14)(q32.13q32.33), quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis of 25 candidate genes located centromerically and telomerically to the 14q32.13 breakpoint was performed. Any of the analyzed genes was commonly overexpressed in the presented cases. Of note, up-regulated transcription of TCL1A was observed in two cases. In summary, we provide evidence that IGH-mediated chromosomal aberrations affecting the 14q32.13/TCL1A-TCL6 region are recurrent in mature B-cell neoplasms with villous lymphocytes. Despite extensive qRT-PCR studies, molecular consequences of these novel aberrations remain elusive.},

  abstract = {Secretory IgA (SIgA) is the most characteristic component of the mucosal immune system and has long been considered the major protective factor that prevents pathogens from invading hosts through the mucosae. Recent studies, however, have suggested that complete immunity against a range of mucosal bacterial and viral pathogens can be achieved in the absence of IgA. Therefore, to further dissect the role of SIgA, we generated mice deficient in the polymeric Ig receptor (pIgR−/− mice). As a result of an inability to transport dimeric IgA to the secretions, pIgR−/− mice are deficient in SIgA and accumulate circulating dimeric IgA, with serum levels 100-fold greater than those observed in normal mice. Examination of lamina propria mononuclear cells showed that pIgR−/− mice had ∼3 times as many IgA-secreting cells as C57BL/6 mice. Further analysis showed that these cells displayed the differentiated IgA+ B220− phenotype and accounted for a 2-fold increase in the number of lamina propria blast cells in the pIgR−/− mice. Subsequent experiments showed that OVA-specific CD4+ T cell expansion following OVA feeding was not elevated in pIgR−/− mice. Furthermore, no differences in CD8+ T cell tolerance or induction of influenza virus-specific CD8+ T cells were detected in pIgR−/− mice compared with controls. Therefore, while SIgA is clearly involved in maintaining some parameters of mucosal homeostasis in the intestine, the mechanisms associated with its barrier function and the clinical consequences of its deficiency are yet to be identified.},

While G-CSF is the most frequently used agent for stem cell mobilization, the use of G-CSF alone results in suboptimal stem cell yields in a significant proportion of patients undergoing autologous transplantation. Plerixafor (AMD3100, Genzyme Corporation) is a bicyclam molecule that antagonizes the binding of the chemokine stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) to its cognate receptor CXCR4. Plerixafor results in the rapid and reversible mobilization of hematopoietic stem cells into the peripheral circulation and is synergistic when combined with G-CSF. In clinical studies of autologous stem cell transplantation, the combination of plerixafor and G-CSF allows the collection of large numbers of stem cells in fewer apheresis sessions and can salvage those who fail G-CSF mobilization alone.},

Further, NE deficiency reduces the penetrance of APL in a murine model of this disease. We therefore predicted that NE-mediated PR cleavage might be important for its ability to initiate APL. To test this hypothesis, we generated a mouse expressing NE-resistant PR. These mice developed APL indistinguishable from wild-type PR, but with significantly reduced latency (median leukemia-free survival of 274 days vs 473 days for wild-type PR, P {$<$} .001). Resistance to proteolysis may increase the abundance of full-length PR protein in early myeloid cells, and our previous data suggested that noncleaved PR may be less toxic to early myeloid cells. Together, these effects appear to increase the leukemogenicity of NE-resistant PR, contrary to our previous prediction. We conclude that NE deficiency may reduce APL penetrance via indirect mechanisms that are still NE dependent.},

  abstract = {A novel human coronavirus (HCoV-EMC/2012) was isolated from a man with acute pneumonia and renal failure in June 2012. This report describes the complete genome sequence, genome organization, and expression strategy of HCoV-EMC/2012 and its relation with known coronaviruses. The genome contains 30,119 nucleotides and contains at least 10 predicted open reading frames, 9 of which are predicted to be expressed from a nested set of seven subgenomic mRNAs. Phylogenetic analysis of the replicase gene of coronaviruses with completely sequenced genomes showed that HCoV-EMC/2012 is most closely related to Tylonycteris bat coronavirus HKU4 (BtCoV-HKU4) and Pipistrellus bat coronavirus HKU5 (BtCoV-HKU5), which prototype two species in lineage C of the genus Betacoronavirus. In accordance with the guidelines of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses, and in view of the 75\% and 77\% amino acid sequence identity in 7 conserved replicase domains with BtCoV-HKU4 and BtCoV-HKU5, respectively, we propose that HCoV-EMC/2012 prototypes a novel species in the genus Betacoronavirus. HCoV-EMC/2012 may be most closely related to a coronavirus detected in Pipistrellus pipistrellus in The Netherlands, but because only a short sequence from the most conserved part of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase-encoding region of the genome was reported for this bat virus, its genetic distance from HCoV-EMC remains uncertain. HCoV-EMC/2012 is the sixth coronavirus known to infect humans and the first human virus within betacoronavirus lineage C. IMPORTANCE: Coronaviruses are capable of infecting humans and many animal species. Most infections caused by human coronaviruses are relatively mild. However, the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) caused by SARS-CoV in 2002 to 2003 and the fatal infection of a human by HCoV-EMC/2012 in 2012 show that coronaviruses are able to cause severe, sometimes fatal disease in humans. We have determined the complete genome of HCoV-EMC/2012 using an unbiased virus discovery approach involving next-generation sequencing techniques, which enabled subsequent state-of-the-art bioinformatics, phylogenetics, and taxonomic analyses. By establishing its complete genome sequence, HCoV-EMC/2012 was characterized as a new genotype which is closely related to bat coronaviruses that are distant from SARS-CoV. We expect that this information will be vital to rapid advancement of both clinical and vital research on this emerging pathogen.},

Here, we characterize the transcriptomic neural diversity in the human forebrain at post-conception weeks (PCW) 8–10. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we find evidence of the emergence of a first wave of oligodendrocyte lineage cells as early as PCW 8, which we also confirm at the epigenomic level through the use of single-cell ATAC-seq. Using regulatory network inference, we predict key transcriptional events leading to the specification of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs). Moreover, by profiling the spatial expression of 50 key genes through the use of in situ sequencing (ISS), we identify regions in the human ventral fetal forebrain where oligodendrogenesis first occurs. Our results indicate evolutionary conservation of the first wave of oligodendrogenesis between mice and humans and describe regulatory mechanisms involved in human OPC specification.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To analyze the occurrence of promoter hypermethylation in primary cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) on a genome-wide scale, focusing on epigenetic alterations with pathogenetic significance. MATERIALS AND METHODS: DNA isolated from biopsy specimens of 28 patients with CTCL, including aggressive CTCL entities (transformed mycosis fungoides and CD30-negative large T-cell lymphoma) and an indolent entity (CD30-positive large T-cell lymphoma), were investigated. For genome-wide DNA methylation screening, differential methylation hybridization using CpG island microarrays was applied, which allows simultaneous detection of the methylation status of 8640 CpG islands. Bisulfite sequence analysis was applied for confirmation and detection of hypermethylation of eight selected tumor suppressor genes. RESULTS: The DNA methylation patterns of CTCLs emerging from differential methylation hybridization analysis included 35 CpG islands hypermethylated in at least four of the 28 studied CTCL samples when compared with benign T-cell samples. Hypermethylation of the putative tumor suppressor genes BCL7a (in 48\% of CTCL samples), PTPRG (27\%), and thrombospondin 4 (52\%) was confirmed and demonstrated to be associated with transcriptional downregulation. BCL7a was hypermethylated at a higher frequency in aggressive (64\%) than in indolent (14\%) CTCL entities. In addition, the promoters of the selected tumor suppressor genes p73 (48\%), p16 (33\%), CHFR (19\%), p15 (10\%), and TMS1 (10\%) were hypermethylated in CTCL. CONCLUSION: Malignant T cells of patients with CTCL display widespread promoter hypermethylation associated with inactivation of several tumor suppressor genes involved in DNA repair, cell cycle, and apoptosis signaling pathways. In view of this, CTCL may be amenable to treatment with demethylating agents.},

The identification and the characterization of enhancers are challenging in mammals due to their genome complexity. Here we develop CapStarr-Seq, a novel high-throughput strategy to quantitatively assess enhancer activity in mammals. This approach couples capture of regions of interest to previously developed Starr-seq technique. Extensive assessment of CapStarr-seq demonstrates accurate quantification of enhancer activity. Furthermore, we find that enhancer strength is associated with binding complexity of tissue-specific transcription factors and super-enhancers, while additive enhancer activity isolates key genes involved in cell identity and function. The CapStarr-Seq thus provides a fast and cost-effective approach to assess the activity of potential enhancers for a given cell type and will be helpful in decrypting transcription regulation mechanisms.},

Users can get predictions for single-nucleotide variants from their organism of interest using the SIFT 4G annotator with SIFT 4G's precomputed databases. The scope of genomic predictions is expanded, with predictions available for more than 200 organisms. Users can also run the SIFT 4G algorithm themselves. SIFT predictions can be retrieved for 6.7 million variants in 4 min once the database has been downloaded. If precomputed predictions are not available, the SIFT 4G algorithm can compute predictions at a rate of 2.6 s per protein sequence. SIFT 4G is available from http://sift-dna.org/sift4g.

  abstract = {Malignant tissue samples may sometimes be the only source of biological material for forensic investigations, including identification of individuals or paternity testing. However, in use of such samples, uncertainties due to microsatellite instability (MSI) and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) often associated with neoplasias may be encountered. In this study, we have analysed the applicability of autosomal tetranucleotide short tandem repeat (STR) markers, which are routinely used in forensic analysis, to gain genetic information. MSI and LOH were analysed in 41 surgically removed gastrointestinal cancer specimens and the adjascent non-cancerous tissue marginals. The cancer specimens showed great variability in their genetic phenotypes due to MSI or LOH, with only 32\% being microsatellite-stable. Of the 15 autosomal STR loci analysed, only TH01 had no MSI-type alteration in these samples. The loci most frequently affected by MSI were D8S1179, D21S11, D18S51 and D19S433 (MSI in 15-17\% of cases). LOH-type alterations were observed at all of the loci, including the amelogenin locus used for sex determination. The highest LOH frequency was found at locus D18S51 (27\%). The genetic alterations at the marker loci may indicate false homozygosity or heterozygosity, and false gender may result from erroneous deduction of DNA profiles. Therefore, typing of autosomal STRs from malignant tissues in forensic settings warrants careful interpretation of MSI and LOH results together with microscopic analysis of a tissue specimen. Results by two commercially available and widely used forensic DNA profiling kits used here were comparable.},

By intersecting our results with genetic risk factors for human brain diseases, we identified the cortical cell types and lineages most vulnerable to genetic insults of different brain disorders, especially autism. We find that lineage-specific gene expression programs up-regulated in female cells are especially enriched for the genetic risk factors of autism.

  abstract = {High-grade gliomas are lethal brain cancers whose progression is robustly regulated by neuronal activity. Activity-regulated release of growth factors promotes glioma growth, but this alone is insufficient to explain the effect that neuronal activity exerts on glioma progression. Here we show that neuron and glioma interactions include electrochemical communication through bona fide AMPA receptor-dependent neuron–glioma synapses. Neuronal activity also evokes non-synaptic activity-dependent potassium currents that are amplified by gap junction-mediated tumour interconnections, forming an electrically coupled network. Depolarization of glioma membranes assessed by in vivo optogenetics promotes proliferation, whereas pharmacologically or genetically blocking electrochemical signalling inhibits the growth of glioma xenografts and extends mouse survival. Emphasizing the positive feedback mechanisms by which gliomas increase neuronal excitability and thus activity-regulated glioma growth, human intraoperative electrocorticography demonstrates increased cortical excitability in the glioma-infiltrated brain. Together, these findings indicate that synaptic and electrical integration into neural circuits promotes glioma progression.},

We dissected these influences in isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)–mutant gliomas by combining 14,226 single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) profiles from 16 patient samples with bulk RNA-seq profiles from 165 patient samples. Differences in bulk profiles between IDH-mutant astrocytoma and oligodendroglioma can be primarily explained by distinct TME and signature genetic events, whereas both tumor types share similar developmental hierarchies and lineages of glial differentiation. As tumor grade increases, we find enhanced proliferation of malignant cells, larger pools of undifferentiated glioma cells, and an increase in macrophage over microglia expression programs in TME. Our work provides a unifying model for IDH-mutant gliomas and a general framework for dissecting the differences among human tumor subclasses.},

  abstract = {MYC-driven medulloblastoma is a major therapeutic challenge due to frequent metastasis and a poor 5-year survival rate. MYC gene amplification results in transcriptional dysregulation, proliferation, and survival of malignant cells. To identify therapeutic targets in MYC-amplified medulloblastoma, we employ a CRISPR-Cas9 essentiality screen targeting 1,140 genes. We identify CDK7 as a mediator of medulloblastoma tumorigenesis. Using chemical inhibitors and genetic depletion, we observe cessation of tumor growth in xenograft mouse models and increases in apoptosis. The results are attributed to repression of a core set of MYC-driven transcriptional programs mediating DNA repair. CDK7 inhibition alters RNA polymerase II (RNA Pol II) and MYC association at DNA repair genes. Blocking CDK7 activity sensitizes cells to ionizing radiation leading to accrual of DNA damage, extending survival and tumor latency in xenograft mouse models. Our studies establish the selective inhibition of MYC-driven medulloblastoma by CDK7 inhibition combined with radiation as a viable therapeutic strategy.},

Decades of anatomical and functional studies have led to an overall model of how the GC reaction and affinity-based selection operate. More recently, the introduction of intravital imaging into the GC field has opened the door to direct investigation of certain key dynamic features of this microanatomic structure, sparking renewed interest in the relationship between cell movement and affinity maturation. We review these and other recent advances in our understanding of GCs, focusing on cellular dynamics and on the mechanism of selection of high-affinity B cells.},

Gene mutations underlying the molecular pathogenesis of the disease are incompletely characterized. Here, we describe novel somatic IL4R mutations in 15 of 62 primary cases of PMBCL (24.2\%) and in all PMBCL-derived cell lines tested. The majority of mutations (11/21; 52\%) were hotspot single nucleotide variants in exon 8, leading to an I242N amino acid change in the transmembrane domain. Functional analyses establish this mutation as gain of function leading to constitutive activation of the JAK-STAT pathway and upregulation of downstream cytokine expression profiles and B cell–specific antigens. Moreover, expression of I242N mutant IL4R in a mouse xenotransplantation model conferred growth advantage in vivo. The pattern of concurrent mutations within the JAK-STAT signaling pathway suggests additive/synergistic effects of these gene mutations contributing to lymphomagenesis. Our data establish IL4R mutations as novel driver alterations and provide a strong preclinical rationale for therapeutic targeting of JAK-STAT signaling in PMBCL.},

Here we show the intrinsic requirement for miR-155 in B cell responses to thymus-dependent and -independent antigens. B cells lacking miR-155 generated reduced extrafollicular and germinal center responses and failed to produce high-affinity IgG1 antibodies. Gene-expression profiling of activated B cells indicated that miR-155 regulates an array of genes with diverse function, many of which are predicted targets of miR-155. The transcription factor Pu.1 is validated as a direct target of miR155-mediated inhibition. When Pu.1 is overexpressed in wild-type B cells, fewer IgG1 cells are produced, indicating that loss of Pu.1 regulation is a contributing factor to the miR-155-deficient phenotype. Our results implicate post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression for establishing the terminal differentiation program of B cells.},

  abstract = {The transcription factor EBF1 is essential for lineage specification in early B cell development. In this study, we demonstrate by conditional mutagenesis that EBF1 is required for B cell commitment, pro–B cell development, and subsequent transition to the pre–B cell stage. Later in B cell development, EBF1 was essential for the generation and maintenance of several mature B cell types. Marginal zone and B-1 B cells were lost, whereas follicular (FO) and germinal center (GC) B cells were reduced in the absence of EBF1. Activation of the B cell receptor resulted in impaired intracellular signaling, proliferation and survival of EBF1-deficient FO B cells. Immune responses were severely reduced upon Ebf1 inactivation, as GCs were formed but not maintained. ChIP- and RNA-sequencing of FO B cells identified EBF1-activated genes that encode receptors, signal transducers, and transcriptional regulators implicated in B cell signaling. Notably, ectopic expression of EBF1 efficiently induced the development of B-1 cells at the expense of conventional B cells. These gain- and loss-of-function analyses uncovered novel important functions of EBF1 in controlling B cell immunity.},

  abstract = {Introduction SOX11 is a transcription factor (TF) aberrantly expressed in the majority of mantle cell lymphomas (MCLs), which is generally associated with aggressive clinical behaviour. No mutations, genetic aberrations or direct correlations with differential DNA methylation at the promoter related to its expression have been found in MCL. Deeper insights into its regulation can be found by considering the three-dimensional (3D) chromatin structure. It is becoming clear that the genome can be partitioned into 3D building blocks, topologically associated domains (TADs) and that enhancer regions likely regulate genes within their TADs by 3D contacts, but do not affect genes outside their own TADs. By mapping the 3D chromatin structure, we previously identified a distant putative SOX11 enhancer showing enhancer activity and 3D contacts with the SOX11 gene in the SOX11-positive MCL cell line Z-138, but not in the SOX11-negative MCL cell line JVM-2. Aims We aimed to deepen our understanding of the differential 3D contacts and enhancer activity previously observed at the putative SOX11 enhancer in SOX11-positive versus SOX11-negative MCL cell lines by addressing the following questions: (i) Do TAD boundaries around the SOX11 locus change between SOX11-positive and -negative MCLs? (ii) How do the 3D contacts and chromatin states at this region behave in primary MCL cases and normal B cells? (iii) Is the putative SOX11 enhancer involved in SOX11 expression in other tissues? Methods We have extended our experimental analyses of the putative SOX11 enhancer by performing (i) HiC-sequencing and 3D fluorescence in situ hybridization (3D FISH) in MCL cell lines Z-138 and JVM-2, (ii) 4C-sequencing, chromatin inmmunoprecipiation followed by deep sequencing (ChIP-seq) of 6 histone marks, an Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin with deep sequencing (ATAC-seq) and chromatin state modeling by chromHMM (using the 6 histone marks) in primary MCL cases and normal naive and memory B-cells. Furthermore, we have explored the activity of this region in other SOX11 expressing cell lines studied within the ENCODE Consortium. Results HiC-sequencing in the cell lines Z-138 (SOX11-positive) and JVM-2 (SOX11-negative) showed that the SOX11 locus and its putative enhancer are located within the same TAD in both samples. Hence, shifts in TAD boundaries do not seem to underlie the differential 3D chromatin interactions between the SOX11 locus and its putative enhancer in these two cell lines. By ChIP-seq and chromatin state modeling we observed that the promoter of SOX11 is poised, i.e., carrying histone marks H3K4me3 and H3K27me3, in normal naive and memory B-cells and the SOX11-negative MCL primary case. Furthermore, we observed weak enhancer activity at the putative SOX11 enhancer in normal naive and memory B-cells and the SOX11-negative MCL primary case, but strong enhancer activity, marked by the presence of H3K27ac, only in SOX11-positive samples. In addition, by ATAC-seq we identified two specific chromatin accessible regions that potentially represent the transcription factor binding sites responsible for activation of this enhancer region in SOX11-positive MCLs. By 4C-sequencing we observed that the SOX11 locus and its putative enhancer show high 3D contacts in two other SOX11-positive MCL cell lines (GRANTA-519 and JEKO-1) and in a SOX11-positive primary MCL case, but not in a SOX11-negative primary MCL case. Furthermore, the differential 3D contacts at these regions in Z-138 and JVM-2 were confirmed by 3D FISH, which is currently being performed in primary MCL cases. Interestingly, no 3D contacts were observed in normal naive and memory B cells, indicating that although the SOX11 promoter is poised within these normal B-cell subpopulations, primed looping at these regions does not exist and seems not to explain the 3D contacts we observed in SOX11-positive MCL cell lines and primary cases. When investigating chromatin states in cell lines studied by ENCODE with an active SOX11 promoter (H1-hESC, HSMM and NHLF) none of them show activity in the identified region, suggesting that the putative SOX11 enhancer is de novo activated only in the context of MCL lymphomagenesis. Conclusions We provide new evidence that the activation of a distant SOX11 putative enhancer and its 3D contacts to the SOX11 gene, is a de novo event in SOX11-positive MCL cell lines and primary cases that is likely specific for this malignancy.

  abstract = {Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a B-cell malignancy in need of new, effective, and safe therapies. The recently identified IgM receptor FcμR is overexpressed on malignant B cells in CLL and mediates the rapid internalization and lysosomal shuttling of IgM via its Fc fragment (Fcμ). To exploit this internalization and trafficking pathway for targeted drug delivery, we engineered an IgM derived protein scaffold (Fcμ) and linked it with the cytotoxic agent monomethylauristatin F. This Fcμ-drug conjugate was selectively toxic for FcμR expressing cell lines in vitro and for CLL cells but not autologous normal T cells ex vivo. Notably, the cytotoxic activity of the Fcμ-drug conjugate was maintained in CLL cells carrying a 17p deletion, which predicts resistance to standard chemotherapy. Next, we tested the possible therapeutic application of the Fcμ-drug conjugate in immunodeficient NSG mice engrafted with peripheral blood cells from leukemia patients. Three intravenous injections of the Fcμ-drug conjugate over a 10 day period were well tolerated and selectively killed the human CLL cells but not the co-engrafted autologous human T cells. In summary, we developed a novel strategy for targeted cytotoxic therapy of CLL based on the unique properties of FcμR. FcμR-targeted drug delivery showed potent and specific therapeutic activity in CLL, thus providing proof-of-concept for FcμR as a valuable therapeutic target in CLL and for IgM-based antibody drug conjugates as a new targeting platform.},

FcµR is expressed on human CD19+ B cells, CD4+/CD8+ T cells, and CD56+/CD3− NK cells, and has been shown to be overexpressed in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells. CLL is a malignancy of mature IgM+ B lymphocytes that display features of polyreactive, partially anergized B cells related to memory B cells. Herein, we report that FcµR is O-glycosylated in its extracellular domain and identify the major sites of O-glycosylation. By employing immunofluorescence confocal microscopy, we found that FcµR localized to the cell membrane, but also found that large pools of FcµR accumulate in the trans-Golgi network. Aggregation of FcµR on CLL cells by IgM prompted rapid internalization of both IgM and FcµR, reaching half maximal internalization of cell bound IgM within one minute. Upon internalization, FcµR transported IgM through the endocytic pathway to the lysosome, where it was degraded. Using a series of FcµR deletion mutants, we identified a proline-rich domain essential for cell surface expression of FcµR and a second domain, containing a YXXΦ motif, that controls internalization. While it has been reported, that BCR activation increases FcµR expression; we found that activation of TLRs strongly downregulated FcµR at both the mRNA and protein levels. Through internalization of IgM bound immune complexes, FcµR may play a role in immune surveillance and contribute to B-cell activation. In addition, FcµR deserves study as a potential pathway for the delivery of therapeutic antibody-drug conjugates into CLL cells.},

Distant-acting transcriptional enhancers — a major category of functional non-coding DNA — are involved in many developmental and disease-relevant processes.

E2 functions through sequence-specific binding to 12-bp DNA motifs-E2 binding sites (E2BS)-in the virus genome. Papillomaviruses are able to establish persistent infection in their host and have developed a long-term relationship with the host cell in order to guarantee the propagation of the virus. In this study, we have analyzed the occurrence and functionality of E2BSs in the human genome. Our computational analysis indicates that most E2BSs in the human genome are found in repetitive DNA regions and have G/C-rich spacer sequences. Using a chromatin immunoprecipitation approach, we show that human papillomavirus type 11 (HPV11) E2 interacts with a subset of cellular E2BSs located in active chromatin regions. Two E2 activities, sequence-specific DNA binding and interaction with cellular Brd4 protein, are important for E2 binding to consensus sites. E2 binding to cellular E2BSs has a moderate or no effect on cellular transcription. We suggest that the preference of HPV E2 proteins for E2BSs with A/T-rich spacers, which are present in the viral genomes and underrepresented in the human genome, ensures E2 binding to specific binding sites in the virus genome and may help to prevent extensive and possibly detrimental changes in cellular transcription in response to the viral protein.},

Specifically, these five essays are concerned with some of the major problems of classical biology: the precise character of biological organisation, the processes which generate it, and the specifics of evolution. With regard to these issues, some thinkers suggest that biological organisms are not merely distinguishable from inanimate ‘things’ in terms of complexity, but are in fact radically different qualitatively: they exemplify some constitutive principle which is not elsewhere manifested. It is the desire to bring such ideas into conformity with our understanding of analytical biology which unifies these essays. They explore the contours of a conceptual framework sufficiently wide to embrace all aspects of living systems.},

  abstract = {KRAS- and BRAF-mutant tumors are often dependent on MAPK signaling for proliferation and survival and thus sensitive to MAPK pathway inhibitors. However, clinical studies have shown that MEK inhibitors are not uniformly effective in these cancers indicating that mutational status of these oncogenes does not accurately capture MAPK pathway activity. A number of transcripts are regulated by this pathway and are recurrently identified in genome-based MAPK transcriptional signatures. To test whether the transcriptional output of only 10 of these targets could quantify MAPK pathway activity with potential predictive or prognostic clinical utility, we created a MAPK Pathway Activity Score (MPAS) derived from aggregated gene expression. In vitro, MPAS predicted sensitivity to MAPK inhibitors in multiple cell lines, comparable to or better than larger genome-based statistical models. Bridging in vitro studies and clinical samples, median MPAS from a given tumor type correlated with cobimetinib (MEK inhibitor) sensitivity of cancer cell lines originating from the same tissue type. Retrospective analyses of clinical datasets showed that MPAS was associated with the sensitivity of melanomas to vemurafenib (HR: 0.596) and negatively prognostic of overall or progression-free survival in both adjuvant and metastatic CRC (HR: 1.5 and 1.4), adrenal cancer (HR: 1.7), and HER2+ breast cancer (HR: 1.6). MPAS thus demonstrates potential clinical utility that warrants further exploration.},

  abstract = {Cytogenetic analysis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells has accelerated the identification of genes important for AML pathogenesis. To complement cytogenetic studies and to identify genes altered in AML genomes, we performed genome-wide copy number analysis with paired normal and tumor DNA obtained from 86 adult patients with de novo AML using 1.85 million feature SNP arrays. Acquired copy number alterations (CNAs) were confirmed using an ultra-dense array comparative genomic hybridization platform. A total of 201 somatic CNAs were found in the 86 AML genomes (mean, 2.34 CNAs per genome), with French-American-British system M6 and M7 genomes containing the most changes (10-29 CNAs per genome). Twenty-four percent of AML patients with normal cytogenetics had CNA, whereas 40\% of patients with an abnormal karyotype had additional CNA detected by SNP array, and several CNA regions were recurrent. The mRNA expression levels of 57 genes were significantly altered in 27 of 50 recurrent CNA regions {$<$}5 megabases in size. A total of 8 uniparental disomy (UPD) segments were identified in the 86 genomes; 6 of 8 UPD calls occurred in samples with a normal karyotype. Collectively, 34 of 86 AML genomes (40\%) contained alterations not found with cytogenetics, and 98\% of these regions contained genes. Of 86 genomes, 43 (50\%) had no CNA or UPD at this level of resolution. In this study of 86 adult AML genomes, the use of an unbiased high-resolution genomic screen identified many genes not previously implicated in AML that may be relevant for pathogenesis, along with many known oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes.},

We present MuSiC, a method that utilizes cell-type specific gene expression from single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data to characterize cell type compositions from bulk RNA-seq data in complex tissues. By appropriate weighting of genes showing cross-subject and cross-cell consistency, MuSiC enables the transfer of cell type-specific gene expression information from one dataset to another. When applied to pancreatic islet and whole kidney expression data in human, mouse, and rats, MuSiC outperformed existing methods, especially for tissues with closely related cell types. MuSiC enables the characterization of cellular heterogeneity of complex tissues for understanding of disease mechanisms. As bulk tissue data are more easily accessible than single-cell RNA-seq, MuSiC allows the utilization of the vast amounts of disease relevant bulk tissue RNA-seq data for elucidating cell type contributions in disease.},

  abstract = {Activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) converts cytosine into uracil to initiate somatic hypermutation (SHM) and class switch recombination (CSR) of antibody genes. In addition, this enzyme produces DNA lesions at off-target sites that lead to mutations and chromosome translocations. However, AID is mostly cytoplasmic, and how and exactly when it accesses nuclear DNA remains enigmatic. Here, we show that AID is transiently in spatial contact with genomic DNA from the time the nuclear membrane breaks down in prometaphase until early G1, when it is actively exported into the cytoplasm. Consistent with this observation, the immunoglobulin (Igh) gene deamination as measured by uracil accumulation occurs primarily in early G1 after chromosomes decondense. Altering the timing of cell cycle–regulated AID nuclear residence increases DNA damage at off-target sites. Thus, the cell cycle–controlled breakdown and reassembly of the nuclear membrane and the restoration of transcription after mitosis constitute an essential time window for AID-induced deamination, and provide a novel DNA damage mechanism restricted to early G1.},

Here, we report the patterns derived from the analysis of 39 histone modifications in human CD4(+) T cells. Our data indicate that a large number of patterns are associated with promoters and enhancers. In particular, we identify a common modification module consisting of 17 modifications detected at 3,286 promoters. These modifications tend to colocalize in the genome and correlate with each other at an individual nucleosome level. Genes associated with this module tend to have higher expression, and addition of more modifications to this module is associated with further increased expression. Our data suggest that these histone modifications may act cooperatively to prepare chromatin for transcriptional activation.},

Recent in vitro analysis suggests C3b can inhibit mAb-induced natural killer (NK)–cell activation and ADCC. Further studies were conducted to assess the effect of C3 depletion on mAb-induced NK activation and therapy of lymphoma. Normal human serum inhibited the ability of rituximab-coated lymphoma cells to activate NK cells as previously reported. Serum did not inhibit NK-cell activation when it was preincubated with cobra venom factor (CVF) to deplete C3. Similar results were found when transudative pleural fluid or nonmalignant ascites was used as surrogates for extravascular fluid, suggesting the inhibitory effect of complement may be present in the extravascular compartment, in which many malignant lymphocytes reside. In vivo, C3 was depleted before mAb treatment in a syngeneic murine model of lymphoma. Survival of lymphoma-bearing mice after treatment with CVF plus mAb and with a human C3 derivative with CVF-like functions (HC3-1496) plus mAb was both superior to that of mAb alone. These studies show that complement depletion enhances NK-cell activation induced by rituximab-coated target cells and improves the efficacy of mAb therapy in a murine lymphoma model.},

  abstract = {Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is one of the leading causes of cancer-related mortality, and responds badly to existing treatment. Thus, it is of urgent need to identify novel prognostic markers and therapeutic targets of DLBCL. Recent studies have shown that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play an important role in the development of cancer. By using the next generation HiSeq sequencing assay, we determined lncRNAs exhibiting differential expression between DLBCL patients and healthy controls. Then, RT-qPCR was performed for identification in clinical samples and cell materials, and lncRNA PANDA was verified to be down-regulated in DLBCL patients and have considerable diagnostic potential. In addition, decreased serum PANDA level was correlated to poorer clinical outcome and lower overall survival in DLBCL patients. Subsequently, we determined the experimental role of lncRNA PANDA in DLBCL progression. Luciferase reporter assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay suggested that lncRNA PANDA was induced by p53 and p53 interacts with the promoter region of PANDA. Cell functional assay further indicated that PANDA functioned as a tumor suppressor gene through the suppression of cell growth by a G0/G1 cell cycle arrest in DLBCL. More importantly, Cignal Signal Transduction Reporter Array and western blot assay showed that lncRNA PANDA inactivated the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway. In conclusion, our integrated approach demonstrates that PANDA in DLBCL confers a tumor suppressive function through inhibiting cell proliferation and silencing MAPK/ERK signaling pathway. Thus, PANDA may be a promising therapeutic target for patients with DLBCL.},

  abstract = {Mutations in the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) can cause Weaver-like syndrome, wherein a patient cohort exhibits abnormal white matter; however, PRC2 functions in CNS myelination and regeneration remain elusive. We show here that H3K27me3, the PRC2 catalytic product, increases during oligodendrocyte maturation. Depletion of embryonic ectoderm development (EED), a core PRC2 subunit, reduces differentiation of oligodendrocyte progenitors (OPCs), and causes an OPC-to-astrocyte fate switch in a region-specific manner. Although dispensable for myelin maintenance, EED is critical for oligodendrocyte remyelination. Genomic occupancy and transcriptomic analyses indicate that EED establishes a chromatin landscape that selectively represses inhibitory WNT and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling, and senescence-associated programs. Blocking WNT or BMP pathways partially restores differentiation defects in EED-deficient OPCs. Thus, our findings reveal that EED/PRC2 is a crucial epigenetic programmer of CNS myelination and repair, while demonstrating a spatiotemporal-specific role of PRC2-mediated chromatin silencing in shaping oligodendrocyte identity and lineage plasticity.},

Chronic viral infection by CMV is implicated as a driver of clonal T cell proliferations in some aging humans, but whether CMV or EBV infection contributes to alterations in the B cell repertoire with age is unclear. We have used high-throughput DNA sequencing of IGH gene rearrangements to study the BCR repertoires over two successive years in 27 individuals ranging in age from 20 to 89 y. Some features of the B cell repertoire remain stable with age, but elderly subjects show increased numbers of B cells with long CDR3 regions, a trend toward accumulation of more highly mutated IgM and IgG Ig genes, and persistent clonal B cell populations in the blood. Seropositivity for CMV or EBV infection alters B cell repertoires, regardless of the individual’s age: EBV infection correlates with the presence of persistent clonal B cell expansions, whereas CMV infection correlates with the proportion of highly mutated Ab genes. These findings isolate effects of aging from those of chronic viral infection on B cell repertoires and provide a baseline for understanding human B cell responses to vaccination or infectious stimuli.},

Here we identify interferon regulatory factor 8 (IRF8) as another component of this complex, and show that it also modulates lineage choice by hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). IRF8 binds directly to an IRF8/Ets consensus sequence located in promoter regions of Sfpi1 and Ebf1, which encode PU.1 and EBF, respectively, and is associated with transcriptional repression of Sfpi1 and transcriptional activation of Ebf1. Bone marrows of IRF8 knockout mice (IRF8−/−) had significantly reduced numbers of pre-pro-B cells and increased numbers of myeloid cells. Although HSCs of IRF8−/− mice failed to differentiate to B220+ B-lineage cells in vitro, the defect could be rescued by transfecting HSCs with wild-type but not with a signaling-deficient IRF8 mutant. In contrast, overexpression of IRF8 in HSC-differentiated progenitor cells resulted in growth inhibition and apoptosis. We also found that IRF8 was expressed at higher levels in pre-pro-B cells than more mature B cells in wild-type mice. Together, these results indicate that IRF8 modulates lineage choice by HSCs and is part of the transcriptional network governing B-cell lineage specification, commitment, and differentiation.},

  abstract = {The genome is extensively transcribed into long intergenic noncoding RNAs (lincRNAs), many of which are implicated in gene silencing. Potential roles of lincRNAs in gene activation are much less understood. Development and homeostasis require coordinate regulation of neighbouring genes through a process termed locus control. Some locus control elements and enhancers transcribe lincRNAs, hinting at possible roles in long-range control. In vertebrates, 39 Hox genes, encoding homeodomain transcription factors critical for positional identity, are clustered in four chromosomal loci; the Hox genes are expressed in nested anterior-posterior and proximal-distal patterns colinear with their genomic position from 3′ to 5′of the cluster. Here we identify HOTTIP, a lincRNA transcribed from the 5′ tip of the HOXA locus that coordinates the activation of several 5′ HOXA genes in vivo. Chromosomal looping brings HOTTIP into close proximity to its target genes. HOTTIP RNA binds the adaptor protein WDR5 directly and targets WDR5/MLL complexes across HOXA, driving histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation and gene transcription. Induced proximity is necessary and sufficient for HOTTIP RNA activation of its target genes. Thus, by serving as key intermediates that transmit information from higher order chromosomal looping into chromatin modifications, lincRNAs may organize chromatin domains to coordinate long-range gene activation.},

  abstract = {The topology of the gene-regulatory network has been extensively analyzed. Now, given the large amount of available functional genomic data, it is possible to go beyond this and systematically study regulatory circuits in terms of logic elements. To this end, we present Loregic, a computational method integrating gene expression and regulatory network data, to characterize the cooperativity of regulatory factors. Loregic uses all 16 possible two-input-one-output logic gates (e.g. AND or XOR) to describe triplets of two factors regulating a common target. We attempt to find the gate that best matches each triplet's observed gene expression pattern across many conditions. We make Loregic available as a general-purpose tool (github.com/gersteinlab/loregic). We validate it with known yeast transcription-factor knockout experiments. Next, using human ENCODE ChIP-Seq and TCGA RNA-Seq data, we are able to demonstrate how Loregic characterizes complex circuits involving both proximally and distally regulating transcription factors (TFs) and also miRNAs. Furthermore, we show that MYC, a well-known oncogenic driving TF, can be modeled as acting independently from other TFs (e.g., using OR gates) but antagonistically with repressing miRNAs. Finally, we inter-relate Loregic's gate logic with other aspects of regulation, such as indirect binding via protein-protein interactions, feed-forward loop motifs and global regulatory hierarchy.},

  abstract = {Summary Mice carrying mutations in multiple genes are traditionally generated by sequential recombination in embryonic stem cells and/or time-consuming intercrossing of mice with a single mutation. The CRISPR/Cas system has been adapted as an efficient gene-targeting technology with the potential for multiplexed genome editing. We demonstrate that CRISPR/Cas-mediated gene editing allows the simultaneous disruption of five genes (Tet1, 2, 3, Sry, Uty - 8 alleles) in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells with high efficiency. Coinjection of Cas9 mRNA and single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs) targeting Tet1 and Tet2 into zygotes generated mice with biallelic mutations in both genes with an efficiency of 80\%. Finally, we show that coinjection of Cas9 mRNA/sgRNAs with mutant oligos generated precise point mutations simultaneously in two target genes. Thus, the CRISPR/Cas system allows the one-step generation of animals carrying mutations in multiple genes, an approach that will greatly accelerate the in~vivo study of functionally redundant genes and of epistatic gene interactions.},

IgM, IgG2a, and IgG3 levels are reduced, and T cell–independent antibody production is absent. The similarity to Btk- or Blnk-deficient mice demonstrates that PLCγ2 is downstream in Btk/Blnk signaling. FcRγ signaling is also defective, resulting in a loss of collagen-induced platelet aggregation, mast cell FcεR function, and NK cell FcγRIII and 2B4 function. The results define a signal transduction pathway broadly utilized by immunoglobulin superfamily receptors.},

Here, we show that PRC2 is required for oligodendrocyte (OL) differentiation and myelination, but not for OL precursor formation. PRC2-deficient OL lineage cells differentiate into OL precursors, but they fail to trigger the molecular program for myelination, highlighting that PRC2 is essential for directing the differentiation timing of OL precursors. PRC2 null OL lineage cells aberrantly induce Notch pathway genes and acquire astrocytic features. The repression of the Notch pathway restores the myelination program and inhibits abnormal astrocytic differentiation in the PRC2-deficient OL lineage, indicating that Notch is a major target of PRC2.

  abstract = {PRC2 creates the repressive mark histone H3 Lys27 trimethylation. Although PRC2 is involved in various biological processes, its role in glial development remains ambiguous. Here, we show that PRC2 is required for oligodendrocyte (OL) differentiation and myelination, but not for OL precursor formation. PRC2-deficient OL lineage cells differentiate into OL precursors, but they fail to trigger the molecular program for myelination, highlighting that PRC2 is essential for directing the differentiation timing of OL precursors. PRC2 null OL lineage cells aberrantly induce Notch pathway genes and acquire astrocytic features. The repression of the Notch pathway restores the myelination program and inhibits abnormal astrocytic differentiation in the PRC2-deficient OL lineage, indicating that Notch is a major target of PRC2. Altogether, our studies propose a specific action of PRC2 as a novel gatekeeper that determines the glial fate choice and the timing of OL lineage progression and myelination by impinging on the Notch pathway.},

Wang et al. have developed an imaging method to map the position of multiple regions on individual chromosomes, and the results confirm that chromatin is organized into large contact domains called TADS (topologically associating domains). Unexpectedly, though, folding deviates from the classical fractal-globule model at large length scales. Science, this issue p. 598 The spatial organization of chromatin critically affects genome function. Recent chromosome-conformation-capture studies have revealed topologically associating domains (TADs) as a conserved feature of chromatin organization, but how TADs are spatially organized in individual chromosomes remains unknown. Here, we developed an imaging method for mapping the spatial positions of numerous genomic regions along individual chromosomes and traced the positions of TADs in human interphase autosomes and X chromosomes. We observed that chromosome folding deviates from the ideal fractal-globule model at large length scales and that TADs are largely organized into two compartments spatially arranged in a polarized manner in individual chromosomes. Active and inactive X chromosomes adopt different folding and compartmentalization configurations. These results suggest that the spatial organization of chromatin domains can change in response to regulation. Imaging that maps chromatin domains reveals polarized arrangements of chromatin compartments and nonfractal chromosome folding.

Sequence comparison and modeling analysis have revealed a putative receptor-binding domain (RBD) on the viral spike, which mediates this interaction. We report the 3.0 Å-resolution crystal structure of MERS-CoV RBD bound to the extracellular domain of human DPP4. Our results show that MERS-CoV RBD consists of a core and a receptor-binding subdomain. The receptor-binding subdomain interacts with DPP4 β-propeller but not its intrinsic hydrolase domain. MERS-CoV RBD and related SARS-CoV RBD share a high degree of structural similarity in their core subdomains, but are notably divergent in the receptor-binding subdomain. Mutagenesis studies have identified several key residues in the receptor-binding subdomain that are critical for viral binding to DPP4 and entry into the target cell. The atomic details at the interface between MERS-CoV RBD and DPP4 provide structural understanding of the virus and receptor interaction, which can guide development of therapeutics and vaccines against MERS-CoV infection.},

  abstract = {Females have a greater immunological advantage than men, yet they are more prone to autoimmune disorders. The basis for this sex bias lies in the X chromosome, which contains many immunity-related genes. Female mammals use X chromosome inactivation (XCI) to generate a transcriptionally silent inactive X chromosome (Xi) enriched with heterochromatic modifications and XIST/Xist RNA, which equalizes gene expression between the sexes. Here, we examine the maintenance of XCI in lymphocytes from females in mice and humans. Strikingly, we find that mature naïve T and B cells have dispersed patterns of XIST/Xist RNA, and they lack the typical heterochromatic modifications of the Xi. In vitro activation of lymphocytes triggers the return of XIST/Xist RNA transcripts and some chromatin marks (H3K27me3, ubiquitin-H2A) to the Xi. Single-cell RNA FISH analysis of female T cells revealed that the X-linked immunity genes CD40LG and CXCR3 are biallelically expressed in some cells. Using knockout and knockdown approaches, we find that Xist RNA-binding proteins, YY1 and hnRNPU, are critical for recruitment of XIST/Xist RNA back to the Xi. Furthermore, we examined B cells from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, an autoimmune disorder with a strong female bias, and observed different XIST RNA localization patterns, evidence of biallelic expression of immunity-related genes, and increased transcription of these genes. We propose that the Xi in female lymphocytes is predisposed to become partially reactivated and to overexpress immunity-related genes, providing the first mechanistic evidence to our knowledge for the enhanced immunity of females and their increased susceptibility for autoimmunity.},

It is characterized by the t(15;17)(q22;q11.2) chromosomal translocation that creates the promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor α (PML-RARA) fusion oncogene. Although this fusion oncogene is known to initiate APL in mice, other cooperating mutations, as yet ill defined, are important for disease pathogenesis. To identify these, we used a mouse model of APL, whereby PML-RARA expressed in myeloid cells leads to a myeloproliferative disease that ultimately evolves into APL. Sequencing of a mouse APL genome revealed 3 somatic, nonsynonymous mutations relevant to APL pathogenesis, of which 1 (Jak1 V657F) was found to be recurrent in other affected mice. This mutation was identical to the JAK1 V658F mutation previously found in human APL and acute lymphoblastic leukemia samples. Further analysis showed that JAK1 V658F cooperated in vivo with PML-RARA, causing a rapidly fatal leukemia in mice. We also discovered a somatic 150-kb deletion involving the lysine (K)-specific demethylase 6A (Kdm6a, also known as Utx) gene, in the mouse APL genome. Similar deletions were observed in 3 out of 14 additional mouse APL samples and 1 out of 150 human AML samples. In conclusion, whole genome sequencing of mouse cancer genomes can provide an unbiased and comprehensive approach for discovering functionally relevant mutations that are also present in human leukemias.},

Under the control of a retroviral long terminal repeat, MyoD was expressed in a variety of differentiated cell types by using either a DNA transfection vector or a retrovirus. Expression of muscle-specific proteins was observed in chicken, human, and rat primary fibroblasts and in differentiated melanoma, neuroblastoma, liver, and adipocyte lines. The ability of MyoD to activate muscle genes in a variety of differentiated cell lines suggests that no additional tissue-specific factors other than MyoD are needed to activate the downstream program for terminal muscle differentiation or that, if such factors exist, they are themselves activated by MyoD expression.},

However, for acute myeloid leukemia (AML), normal karyotypes are common, and genomic instability is unusual. To better understand clonal evolution in AML, we sequenced the genomes of M3-AML samples with a known initiating event (PML-RARA) versus the genomes of normal karyotype M1-AML samples and the exomes of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) from healthy people. Collectively, the data suggest that most of the mutations found in AML genomes are actually random events that occurred in HSPCs before they acquired the initiating mutation; the mutational history of that cell is "captured" as the clone expands. In many cases, only one or two additional, cooperating mutations are needed to generate the malignant founding clone. Cells from the founding clone can acquire additional cooperating mutations, yielding subclones that can contribute to disease progression and/or relapse.},

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether whole-genome sequencing can identify cryptic, actionable mutations in a clinically relevant time frame. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENT: We were referred a difficult diagnostic case of acute promyelocytic leukemia with no pathogenic X-RARA fusion identified by routine metaphase cytogenetics or interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). The case patient was enrolled in an institutional review board-approved protocol, with consent specifically tailored to the implications of whole-genome sequencing. The protocol uses a "movable firewall" that maintains patient anonymity within the entire research team but allows the research team to communicate medically relevant information to the treating physician. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical relevance of whole-genome sequencing and time to communicate validated results to the treating physician. RESULTS: Massively parallel paired-end sequencing allowed identification of a cytogenetically cryptic event: a 77-kilobase segment from chromosome 15 was inserted en bloc into the second intron of the RARA gene on chromosome 17, resulting in a classic bcr3 PML-RARA fusion gene. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction sequencing subsequently validated the expression of the fusion transcript. Novel FISH probes identified 2 additional cases of t(15;17)-negative acute promyelocytic leukemia that had cytogenetically invisible insertions. Whole-genome sequencing and validation were completed in 7 weeks and changed the treatment plan for the patient. CONCLUSION: Whole-genome sequencing can identify cytogenetically invisible oncogenes in a clinically relevant time frame.},

The short O-glycan that forms the antigen is carried by a number of different proteins. One potential carrier of the Tn antigen is immunoglobulin A1 (IgA1), which we surprisingly found in tumour cells of the invasive parts of primary breast carcinoma. Conventional immunohistochemical analysis of paraffin-embedded sections from primary breast cancers showed IgA1 to be present in the cytoplasm and plasma membrane of 35 out of 36 individual primary tumours. The immunohistochemical staining of HPA and anti-Tn antibody (GOD3-2C4) did to some extent overlap with the presence of IgA1 in the tumours, but differences were seen in the percentage of stained cells and in the staining pattern in the different breast cancers analysed. Anti-Tn antibody and HPA were also shown to specifically bind to a number of possible constellations of the Tn antigen in the hinge region of IgA1. Both reagents could also detect the presence of Tn positive IgA in serum. On average 51\% of the tumour cells in the individual breast cancer tumour sections showed staining for IgA1. The overall amount of staining in the invasive part of the tumour with the anti Tn antibody was 67\%, and 93\% with HPA. The intra-expression or uptake of IgA1 in breast cancer makes it a new potential carrier of the tumour associated and immunogenic Tn antigen.},

Metazoans, however, use glucose as their main carbon source and have exposure only to low concentrations of extracellular acetate. We have shown that histone acetylation in mammalian cells is dependent on adenosine triphosphate (ATP)–citrate lyase (ACL), the enzyme that converts glucose-derived citrate into acetyl-CoA. We found that ACL is required for increases in histone acetylation in response to growth factor stimulation and during differentiation, and that glucose availability can affect histone acetylation in an ACL-dependent manner. Together, these findings suggest that ACL activity is required to link growth factor–induced increases in nutrient metabolism to the regulation of histone acetylation and gene expression. Histone acetylation and gene expression in mammals are modulated by glycolytic metabolism. Histone acetylation and gene expression in mammals are modulated by glycolytic metabolism.},

We analyzed gene expression profiling data from 350 DLBCL patient samples and detected that activated B-cell-like (ABC) DLBCLs express MCL1 at significantly higher levels compared with germinal center B-cell-like DLBCL patient samples (P=2.7 × 10(-10)). Immunohistochemistry confirmed high MCL1 protein expression predominantly in ABC DLBCL in an independent patient cohort (n=249; P=0.001). To elucidate molecular mechanisms leading to aberrant MCL1 expression, we analyzed array comparative genomic hybridization data of 203 DLBCL samples and identified recurrent chromosomal gains/amplifications of the MCL1 locus that occurred in 26\% of ABC DLBCLs. In addition, aberrant STAT3 signaling contributed to high MCL1 expression in this subtype. Knockdown of MCL1 as well as treatment with the BH3-mimetic obatoclax induced apoptotic cell death in MCL1-positive DLBCL cell lines. In summary, MCL1 is deregulated in a significant fraction of ABC DLBCLs and contributes to therapy resistance. These data suggest that specific inhibition of MCL1 might be utilized therapeutically in a subset of DLBCLs.},

The resulting models accurately predict individual enhancer–promoter interactions across multiple cell lines with a false discovery rate up to 15 times smaller than that obtained using the closest gene. By evaluating the genomic features driving this accuracy, we uncover interactions between structural proteins, transcription factors, epigenetic modifications, and transcription that together distinguish interacting from non-interacting enhancer–promoter pairs. Most of this signature is not proximal to the enhancers and promoters but instead decorates the looping DNA. We conclude that complex but consistent combinations of marks on the one-dimensional genome encode the three-dimensional structure of fine-scale regulatory interactions.},

We show that histone deacetylase inhibitors valproic acid and butyrate dampened AICDA/Aicda (AID) and PRDM1/Prdm1 (Blimp-1) mRNAs by upregulating miR-155, miR-181b, and miR-361 to silence AICDA/Aicda, and miR-23b, miR-30a, and miR-125b to silence PRDM1/Prdm1, in human and mouse B cells. This led to downregulation of AID, Blimp-1, and X-box binding protein 1, thereby inhibiting CSR, SHM, and plasma cell differentiation without altering B cell viability or proliferation. The selectivity of histone deacetylase inhibitor–mediated silencing of AICDA/Aicda and PRDM1/Prdm1 was emphasized by unchanged expression of HoxC4 and Irf4 (important inducers/modulators of AICDA/Aicda), Rev1 and Ung (central elements for CSR/SHM), and Bcl6, Bach2, or Pax5 (repressors of PRDM1/Prdm1 expression), as well as unchanged expression of miR-19a/b, miR-20a, and miR-25, which are not known to regulate AICDA/Aicda or PRDM1/Prdm1. Through these B cell–intrinsic epigenetic mechanisms, valproic acid blunted class-switched and hypermutated T-dependent and T-independent Ab responses in C57BL/6 mice. In addition, it decreased class-switched and hypermutated autoantibodies, ameliorated disease, and extended survival in lupus MRL/Faslpr/lpr mice. Our findings outline epigenetic mechanisms that modulate expression of an enzyme (AID) and transcription factors (Blimp-1 and X-box binding protein 1) that are critical to the B cell differentiation processes that underpin Ab and autoantibody responses. They also provide therapeutic proof-of-principle in autoantibody-mediated autoimmunity.},

However, without an antecedent "arming" event, NK cells can recognize, but are not equipped to kill, target cells. How NK cells become armed in vivo in healthy hosts is unclear. Because latent herpesviruses are highly prevalent and alter multiple aspects of host immunity, we hypothesized that latent herpesvirus infection would arm NK cells. Here we show that NK cells from mice latently infected with Murid herpesvirus 4 (MuHV-4) were armed as evidenced by increased granzyme B protein expression, cytotoxicity, and interferon-gamma production. NK-cell arming occurred rapidly in the latently infected host and did not require acute viral infection. Furthermore, NK cells armed by latent infection protected the host against a lethal lymphoma challenge. Thus, the immune environment created by latent herpesvirus infection provides a mechanism whereby host NK-cell function is enhanced in vivo.},

Transgenic mice lacking expression of RUNX1 or the RUNX protein-binding partner, CBFbeta, have defective B-cell development, with differentiation blocked at an early stage. Specific knockout of RUNX1 in adult hematopoietic cells also caused a decrease in the number of mature B cells, supporting a role for RUNX1 in both developmental and adult hematopoiesis. Furthermore, RUNX proteins have been shown to regulate several B-cell-specific genes and play an important role in TGF-beta-induced immunoglobulin class switching to IgA. The importance of RUNX1 in B-cell development is additionally demonstrated by its dysregulation in the t(12;21) translocation, which is the most frequent translocation found in acute lymphocytic leukemia. Epstein Barr virus immortalized human B lymphoblastoid cell lines express RUNX3, and cross-regulation of RUNX1 by RUNX3 occurs in these cells. Knockdown of RUNX3 in these cells induces RUNX1 expression and inhibits cell proliferation, directly showing that RUNX proteins can regulate B-cell growth.},

  abstract = {Transcription factors (TFs) recognize short sequence motifs that are present in millions of copies in large eukaryotic genomes. TFsmust distinguish their target binding sites from a vast genomic excess of spurious motif occurrences; however, it is unclear whether functional sites are distinguished from nonfunctional motifs by local primary sequence features or by the larger genomic context in which motifs reside. We used a massively parallel enhancer assay in living mouse retinas to compare 1,300 sequences bound in the genome by the photoreceptor transcription factor Cone-rod homeobox (Crx), to 3,000 control sequences. We found that very short sequences bound in the genome by Crx activated transcription at high levels, whereas unbound genomic regions with equal numbers of Crx motifs did not activate above background levels, even when liberated from their larger genomic context. High local GC content strongly distinguishes bound motifs from unbound motifs across the entire genome. Our results show that the cis-regulatory potential of TF-bound DNA is determined largely by highly local sequence features and not by genomic context.},

  abstract = {Mycosis fungoides (MF) is the most common primary cutaneous T-cell lymphoma variant and is closely related to a rare leukemic variant, Sézary syndrome (SS). MF patients at risk of disease progression can now be identified and an international consortium has been established to address the prognostic relevance of specific biologic factors and define a prognostic index. There are a lack of randomized clinical trial data in MF/SS and evidence is based on a traditional “stage-based” approach; treatment of early-stage disease (IA-IIA) involves skin directed therapies which include topical corticosteroids, phototherapy (psoralen with UVA or UVB), topical chemotherapy, topical bexarotene, and radiotherapy including total skin electron beam therapy. Systemic approaches are used for refractory early-stage and advanced-stage disease (IIB-IV) and include bexarotene, interferon α, extracorporeal photopheresis, histone deacetylase inhibitors, and antibody therapies such as alemtuzumab, systemic chemotherapy, and allogeneic transplantation. However, despite the number of biologic agents available, the treatment of advanced-stage disease still represents an unmet medical need with short duration of responses. Encouragingly, randomized phase 3 trials are assessing novel agents, including brentuximab vedotin and the anti-CCR4 antibody, mogamulizumab. A broader understanding of the biology of MF/SS will hopefully identify more effective targeted therapies.},

  abstract = {DNA methylation is a dynamic epigenetic modification with an important role in cell fate specification and reprogramming. The Ten eleven translocation (Tet) family of enzymes converts 5-methylcytosine to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine, which promotes passive DNA demethylation and functions as an intermediate in an active DNA demethylation process. Tet1/Tet2 double-knockout mice are characterized by developmental defects and epigenetic instability, suggesting a requirement for Tet-mediated DNA demethylation for the proper regulation of gene expression during differentiation. Here, we used whole-genome bisulfite and transcriptome sequencing to characterize the underlying mechanisms. Our results uncover the hypermethylation of DNA methylation canyons as the genomic key feature of Tet1/Tet2 double-knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Canyon hypermethylation coincided with disturbed regulation of associated genes, suggesting a mechanistic explanation for the observed Tet-dependent differentiation defects. Based on these results, we propose an important regulatory role of Tet-dependent DNA demethylation for the maintenance of DNA methylation canyons, which prevents invasive DNA methylation and allows functional regulation of canyon-associated genes.},

These domains segregate in the nuclear space to form active and inactive nuclear compartments, but cause and consequence of compartmentalization are largely unknown. Here, we combined lacO/lacR binding platforms with~allele-specific 4C technologies to track their precise position in the three-dimensional genome upon~recruitment of NANOG, SUV39H1, or EZH2. We observed locked genomic loci resistant to spatial repositioning and unlocked loci that could be repositioned to different nuclear subcompartments with distinct chromatin signatures. Focal protein recruitment caused the entire subTAD, but not surrounding regions, to engage in new genomic contacts. Compartment switching was found uncoupled from transcription changes, and the enzymatic modification of histones per se was insufficient for repositioning. Collectively, this suggests that trans-associated factors influence three-dimensional compartmentalization independent of their cis effect on local chromatin composition and activity.},

We comprehensively characterized 390 H3F3A-mutant diffuse gliomas (201 females, 189 males) arising in pediatric patients (under 20~years old) and adults (20~years and older) evaluated by the CGP program at Foundation Medicine between 2013 and 2020. We assessed information from pathology reports, histopathology review, and clinical data. The cohort included 304 H3K27M-mutant DMG (156 females, 148 males) and 86 H3G34-mutant DHG (45 females, 41 males). Median patient age was 20~years (1–74~years). The frequency of H3K27M-mutant DMG was similar in both pediatric and adult patients in our cohort—48.6\% of the patients were over 20~years old, 31.5\% over 30, and 18\% over 40 at initial diagnosis. FGFR1 hotspot point mutations (N546K and K656E) were exclusively identified in H3K27M-mutant DMG tumors (64/304, 21\%; p\,=\,0.0001); these tend to~occur in older patients (median age: 32.5~years) and mainly arose in the diencephalon. H3K27M-mutant DMG had higher rates of mutations in NF1 (31.0 vs 8.1\%; p\,=\,0.0001) and PIK3CA/PIK3R1 (27.9\% vs 15.1\%; p\,=\,0.016) compared to H3G34-mutant DHG. However, H3G34-mutant DHG had higher rates of targetable alterations in cell-cycle pathway genes (CDK4 and CDK6 amplification; CDKN2A/B deletion) (27.0 vs 9.0\%). Potentially targetable PDGFRA alterations were identified in\,\textasciitilde\,20\% of both H3G34-mutant DHG and H3K27M-mutant DMG. Overall, in the present study H3K27M-mutant DMG occurred at similar rates in both adult and patient patients. Through our analysis, we were able to identify molecular features characteristic of DMG and DHG. By identifying the recurrent co-mutations including actionable FGFR1 point mutations found in nearly one-third of H3K27M-mutant DMG in young adults, our findings can inform clinical translational studies, patient diagnosis, and clinical trial design.},

In addition we address lncRNA deregulation in B-cell malignancies, the putative prognostic value of this as well as the molecular functions of multiple deregulated lncRNAs. Altogether, the discussed work indicates major roles for lncRNAs in normal and malignant B cells affecting oncogenic pathways as well as the response to common therapeutics.},

  abstract = {Myc is a well-known transcription factor with important roles in cell cycle, apoptosis, and cellular transformation. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have recently emerged as an important class of regulatory RNAs. Here, we show that lncRNAs are a main component of the Myc-regulated transcriptional program using the P493-6 tetracycline-repressible myc model. We demonstrate that both Myc-induced mRNAs and lncRNAs are significantly enriched for Myc binding sites. In contrast to Myc-repressed mRNAs, Myc-repressed lncRNAs are significantly enriched for Myc binding sites. Subcellular localization analysis revealed that compared to mRNAs, lncRNAs more often have a specific subcellular localization with a markedly higher percentage of nuclear enrichment within the Myc-repressed lncRNA set. Parallel analysis of differentially expressed lncRNAs and mRNAs identified 105 juxtaposed lncRNA-mRNA pairs, indicative for regulation in cis. To support the potential relevance of the Myc-regulated lncRNAs in cellular transformation, we analyzed their expression in primary Myc-high and Myc-low B-cell lymphomas. In total, 54\% of the lncRNAs differentially expressed between the lymphoma subsets were identified as Myc-regulated in P493-6 cells. This study is the first to show that lncRNAs are an important factor within the Myc-regulated transcriptional program and indicates a marked difference between Myc-repressed lncRNAs and mRNAs.-Winkle, M., van den Berg, A., Tayari, M., Sietzema, J., Terpstra, M., Kortman, G., de Jong, D., Visser, L., Diepstra, A., Kok, K., Kluiver, J.

  abstract = {The yeast LexA interaction trap was used to screen a cDNA library fromArabidopsis thalianain order to identify proteins that interact with the viral protein genome linked (VPg)–proteinase of turnip mosaic potyvirus. The screen allowed the isolation of four candidate cDNA clones. Clones pHC4, pHC21, and pHC40 were partially sequenced but no homologies to known proteins were found. However, the amino acid sequence deduced from the complete nucleotide sequence of pSW56 revealed that it was the eukaryotic initiation factor (iso) 4E [eIF(iso)4E]. Deletion analysis indicated that the VPg domain was involved in the interaction with the plant protein. Interaction between the viral protein and the cellular protein was confirmed by ELISA-based binding experiments. eIF(iso)4E plays an essential role in the initiation of the translation of capped mRNAs and its association with VPg would point to a role of the viral protein in the translation of the virus.},

  abstract = {Cutaneous T-cell lymphomas (CTCL) are a heterogeneous group of malignancies derived from skin-homing T cells. The most common forms of CTCL are Mycosis Fungoides (MF) and Sezary Syndrome (SS). Accurate diagnosis remains a challenge due to the heterogeneity of presentation and the lack of highly characteristic immunophenotypical and genetic markers. Over the past decade molecular studies have improved our understanding of the biology of CTCL. The identification of gene expression differences between normal and malignant T-cells has led to promising new diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers that now need validation to be incorporated into clinical practice. These biomarkers may also provide insight into the mechanism of development of CTCL. Additionally, treatment options have expanded with the approval of new agents, such as histone deacetylase inhibitors. A better understanding of the cell biology, immunology and genetics underlying the development and progression of CTCL will allow the design of more rational treatment strategies for these malignancies. This review summarizes the clinical epidemiology, staging and natural history of MF and SS; discusses the immunopathogenesis of MF and the functional role of the malignant T-cells; and reviews the latest advances in MF and SS treatment.},

  abstract = {Chromatin structure affects the accessibility of DNA to transcription, repair and replication. Changes in chromatin structure occur during development, but less is known about changes during aging. We examined the state of chromatin structure and its effect on gene expression during aging in Drosophila at the whole genome and cellular level using whole genome tiling microarrays of activation and repressive chromatin marks, whole genome transcriptional microarrays and single cell immunohistochemistry. We found dramatic reorganization of chromosomal regions with age. Mapping of H3K9me3 and HP1 signals to fly chromosomes reveals in young flies the expected high enrichment in the pericentric regions, the 4th chromosome and islands of facultative heterochromatin dispersed throughout the genome. With age there is a striking reduction in this enrichment resulting in a nearly equivalent level of H3K9me3 and HP1 in the pericentric regions, the 4th chromosome, facultative heterochromatin and euchromatin. These extensive changes in repressive chromatin marks are associated with alterations in age-related gene expression. Large-scale changes in repressive marks with age are further substantiated by single cell immunohistochemistry that show changes in nuclear distribution of H3K9me3 and HP1 marks with age. Such epigenetic changes are expected to directly or indirectly impinge upon important cellular functions such as gene expression, DNA repair and DNA replication. The combination of genome-wide approaches such as whole genome chromatin immunoprecipitation and transcriptional studies in conjunction with single cell immunohistochemistry as shown here provide a first step toward defining how changes in chromatin may contribute to the process of aging in metazoans.},

  abstract = {Several recent studies have reported detection of HTLV-I genetic sequences in patients with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) including mycosis fungoides and Sezary syndrome. The purpose of this study was to determine whether HTLV-I was detectable in lesional tissues of patients suffering from diseases known to be associated with CTCL. Thirty-five cases were obtained from diverse geographical locations including Ohio, California, Switzerland, and Japan. Six of them had concurrent CTCL. Cases were analyzed using a combination of genomic polymerase chain reaction (PCR)/ Southern blot, dot blot, and Southern blot analyses. All assays were specific for HTLV-I provirus. Sensitivity ranged from approximately 10(-6) for PCR-based studies to 10(-2) for unamplified genomic blotting. Lesional DNA from patients with lymphomatoid papulosis (fourteen cases), Hodgkin's disease (twelve cases), and CD30+ large-cell lymphoma (nine cases) was tested for the HTLV-I proviral pX region using a genomic PCR assay followed by confirmatory Southern blot analysis with a nested oligonucleotide pX probe. All cases were uniformly negative. All of the Hodgkin's disease cases, eight of the large-cell lymphoma cases, and six of the lymphomatoid papulosis cases were then subjected to dot blot analysis of genomic DNA using a full-length HTLV-I proviral DNA probe that spans all regions of the HTLV-I genome. Again, all cases were negative. Finally, eleven of the Hodgkin's disease cases were also subjected to Southern blot analysis of EcoRI-digested genomic DNA using the same full-length HTLV-I probe. Once again, all cases were negative. These findings indicated that, despite utilization of a variety of sensitive and specific molecular biological methods, HTLV-I genetic sequences were not detectable in patients with CTCL-associated lymphoproliferative disorders. These results strongly suggest that the HTLV-I retrovirus is not involved in the pathogenesis of these diseases.},

Immunoglobulin A (IgA), as the principal antibody class in the secretions that bathe these mucosal surfaces, acts as an important first line of defence. IgA, also an important serum immunoglobulin, mediates a variety of protective functions through interaction with specific receptors and immune mediators. The importance of such protection is underlined by the fact that certain pathogens have evolved mechanisms to compromise IgA-mediated defence, providing an opportunity for more effective invasion. IgA function may also be perturbed in certain disease states, some of which are characterized by deposition of IgA in specific tissues.

In the peripheral lymphoid system, mature B cells are activated by self or/and foreign antigens and signals from helper T cells for differentiating into either memory B cells or antibody-producing plasma cells. Accumulating evidence has shown that epigenetic regulations modulate somatic hypermutation and class switch DNA recombination during B-cell activation and differentiation. Any abnormalities in these complex regulatory processes may contribute to aberrant antibody production, resulting in autoimmune pathogenesis such as systemic lupus erythematosus. Newly generated knowledge from advanced modern technologies such as next-generation sequencing, single-cell sequencing and DNA methylation sequencing has enabled us to better understand B-cell biology and its role in autoimmune development. Thus this review aims to summarize current research progress in epigenetic modifications contributing to B-cell activation and differentiation, especially under autoimmune conditions such as lupus, rheumatoid arthritis and type 1 diabetes.},

Each of the four sgRNAs we tested targets dCas9 to between tens and thousands of genomic sites, frequently characterized by a 5-nucleotide seed region in the sgRNA and an NGG protospacer adjacent motif (PAM). Chromatin inaccessibility decreases dCas9 binding to other sites with matching seed sequences; thus 70\% of off-target sites are associated with genes. Targeted sequencing of 295 dCas9 binding sites in mESCs transfected with catalytically active Cas9 identified only one site mutated above background levels. We propose a two-state model for Cas9 binding and cleavage, in which a seed match triggers binding but extensive pairing with target DNA is required for cleavage.},

In contrast, quiescent class-switched memory B cells express high levels of Kv1.3 (∼2000 channels/cell) and maintain their Kv1.3high expression after activation. Consistent with their channel phenotypes, proliferation of naive and IgD+CD27+ memory B cells is suppressed by the specific IKCa1 inhibitor TRAM-34 but not by the potent Kv1.3 blocker Stichodactyla helianthus toxin, whereas the proliferation of class-switched memory B cells is suppressed by Stichodactyla helianthus toxin but not TRAM-34. These changes parallel those reported for T cells. Therefore, specific Kv1.3 and IKCa1 inhibitors may have use in therapeutic manipulation of selective lymphocyte subsets in immunological disorders.},

  abstract = {The promyelocytic leukaemia (PML) protein controls multiple tumour suppressive functions and is downregulated in diverse types of human cancers through incompletely characterized post-translational mechanisms. Here we identify USP11 as a PML regulator by RNAi screening. USP11 deubiquitinates and stabilizes PML, thereby counteracting the functions of PML ubiquitin ligases RNF4 and the KLHL20–Cul3 (Cullin 3)–Roc1 complex. We find that USP11 is transcriptionally repressed through a Notch/Hey1-dependent mechanism, leading to PML destabilization. In human glioma, Hey1 upregulation correlates with USP11 and PML downregulation and with high-grade malignancy. The Notch/Hey1-induced downregulation of USP11 and PML not only confers multiple malignant characteristics of aggressive glioma, including proliferation, invasiveness and tumour growth in an orthotopic mouse model, but also potentiates self-renewal, tumour-forming capacity and therapeutic resistance of patient-derived glioma-initiating cells. Our study uncovers a PML degradation mechanism through Notch/Hey1-induced repression of the PML deubiquitinase USP11 and suggests an important role for this pathway in brain tumour pathogenesis.},

We screened the entire coding region of JAK1 by total exonic resequencing of bone marrow DNA samples from 94 patients with de novo AML. We identified 2 novel somatic mutations in highly conserved residues of the JAK1 gene (T478S, V623A), in 2 separate patients and confirmed these by resequencing germ line DNA samples from the same patients. Overexpression of mutant JAK1 did not transform primary murine cells in standard assays, but compared with wild-type JAK1, JAK1(T478S), and JAK1(V623A) expression was associated with increased STAT1 activation in response to type I interferon and activation of multiple downstream signaling pathways. This is the first report to demonstrate somatic JAK1 mutations in AML and suggests that JAK1 mutations may function as disease-modifying mutations in AML pathogenesis.},

Here, we examined the expression of BCL2, BCL-XL, and MCL1 in primary human hematopoietic subsets and leukemic blasts from AML patients and found that MCL1 transcripts were consistently expressed at high levels in all samples tested. Consistent with this, Mcl1 protein was also highly expressed in myeloid leukemic blasts in a mouse Myc-induced model of AML. We used this model to test the hypothesis that Mcl1 facilitates AML development by allowing myeloid progenitor cells to evade Myc-induced cell death. Indeed, activation of Myc for 7 days in vivo substantially increased myeloid lineage cell numbers, whereas hematopoietic stem, progenitor, and B-lineage cells were depleted. Furthermore, Mcl1 haploinsufficiency abrogated AML development. In addition, deletion of a single allele of Mcl1 from fully transformed AML cells substantially prolonged the survival of transplanted mice. Conversely, the rapid lethality of disease was restored by coexpression of Bcl2 and Myc in Mcl1-haploinsufficient cells. Together, these data demonstrate a critical and dose-dependent role for Mcl1 in AML pathogenesis in mice and suggest that MCL1 may be a promising therapeutic target in patients with de novo AML.},

The present study aimed to investigate the SRGN gene expression and its regulation as downstream signaling of hypoxia-inducible transcription factor 1 alpha (HIF-1α) in colorectal cancer (CRC) cells and tissues. METHODS: The expression of SRGN was analyzed in CRC specimens for its correlation with progression and metastasis. Using chromatin-immunoprecipitation (ChIP), quantitative real-time PCR, Western blot, and transwell assay, the functional role and underlying mechanism of SRGN in CRC metastasis were elucidated. Thus, this study provides evidence of a critical role of SRGN in metastatic progression of CRC. RESULTS: Our results indicated that SRGN overexpression was significantly associated with poor prognosis in CRC specimens. SRGN overexpression promoted CRC cell migration and invasion in vitro; however, SRGN depletion exhibited contrasting effects. Mechanistic investigations revealed that HIF-1α regulated SRGN transcription via physically binding to a hypoxia response element in its promoter region. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, we demonstrated that dysregulated HIF-1α/SRGN signaling promotes CRC progression and metastasis. SRGN may serve as a potential candidate therapeutic target for metastatic CRC.},

Receptor tyrosine kinases stabilized by neuron-glial antigen 2 (NG2) protein are known to induce gliomagenesis. Here, we investigated NG2 expression in a cohort of DIPG specimens (n= 50). We demonstrate NG2 expression in the majority of DIPG specimens tested and determine that tumors harboring histone 3.3 mutation express the highest NG2 levels. We further demonstrate that microRNA 129-2 (miR129-2) is downregulated and hypermethylated in human DIPGs, resulting in the increased expression of NG2. Treatment with 5-Azacytidine, a methyltransferase inhibitor, results in NG2 downregulation in DIPG primary tumor cells in vitro. NG2 expression is altered (symmetric segregation) in mitotic human DIPG and mouse tumor cells. These mitotic cells co-express oligodendrocyte (Olig2) and astrocyte (glial fibrillary acidic protein, GFAP) markers, indicating lack of terminal differentiation. NG2 knockdown retards cellular migration in vitro, while NG2 expressing neurospheres are highly tumorigenic in vivo, resulting in rapid growth of pontine tumors. NG2 expression is targetable in vivo using miR129-2 indicating a potential avenue for therapeutic interventions. This data implicates NG2 as a molecule of interest in DIPGs especially those with H3.3 mutation.},

Analysis of corrected human lymphoblast contact maps provides genome-wide evidence for interchromosomal aggregation of active chromatin marks, including DNase-hypersensitive sites and transcriptionally active foci. We observe extensive long-range (up to 400 kb) cis interactions at active promoters and derive asymmetric contact profiles next to transcription start sites and CTCF binding sites. Clusters of interacting chromosomal domains suggest physical separation of centromere-proximal and centromere-distal regions.

  abstract = {Summary Activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) promotes chromosomal translocations by inducing DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) at immunoglobulin (Ig) genes and oncogenes in the G1 phase. RPA is a single-stranded DNA (ssDNA)-binding protein that associates with resected DSBs in the S phase and facilitates the assembly of factors involved in homologous repair (HR), such as Rad51. Notably, RPA deposition also marks sites of AID-mediated damage, but its role in Ig gene recombination remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that RPA associates asymmetrically with resected ssDNA in response to lesions created by AID, recombination-activating genes (RAG), or other nucleases. Small amounts of RPA are deposited at AID targets in G1~in an ATM-dependent manner. In contrast, recruitment in the S–G2/M phase is extensive, ATM independent, and associated with Rad51 accumulation. In the S–G2/M phase, RPA increases in nonhomologous-end-joining-deficient lymphocytes, where there is more extensive DNA-end resection. Thus, most RPA recruitment during class switch recombination represents salvage of unrepaired breaks by homology-based pathways during the S–G2/M phase of the cell cycle.},

Yan et al. demonstrate that the BMP antagonist Gremlin1 is specifically expressed by CSCs as protection from endogenous BMPs. Gremlin1-overexpressing cells display increased growth and tumor formation, while targeting Gremlin1 in CSCs impairs growth and self-renewal associated with inhibition of p21WAF1/CIP1, a key CSC signaling node., Glioblastomas are the most prevalent and lethal primary brain tumor and are comprised of hierarchies with self-renewing cancer stem cells (CSCs) at the apex. Like neural stem cells (NSCs), CSCs reside in functional niches that provide essential cues to maintain the cellular hierarchy. Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) instruct NSCs to adopt an astrocyte fate and are proposed as anti-CSC therapies to induce differentiation, but, paradoxically, tumors express high levels of BMPs. Here we demonstrate that the BMP antagonist Gremlin1 is specifically expressed by CSCs as protection from endogenous BMPs. Gremlin1 colocalizes with CSCs in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, Gremlin1 blocks prodifferentiation effects of BMPs, and overexpression of Gremlin1 in non-CSCs decreases their endogenous BMP signaling to promote stem-like features. Consequently, Gremlin1-overexpressing cells display increased growth and tumor formation abilities. Targeting Gremlin1 in CSCs results in impaired growth and self-renewal. Transcriptional profiling demonstrated that Gremlin1 effects were associated with inhibition of p21WAF1/CIP1, a key CSC signaling node. This study establishes CSC-derived Gremlin1 as a driving force in maintaining glioblastoma tumor proliferation and glioblastoma hierarchies through the modulation of endogenous prodifferentiation signals.},

While genomic DNA paired-end-tag (DNA-PET) sequencing is an attractive approach to identify genomic SVs, the current application of PET sequencing with short insert size DNA can be insufficient for the comprehensive mapping of SVs in low complexity and repeat-rich genomic regions. We employed a recently developed procedure to generate PET sequencing data using large DNA inserts of 10-20 kb and compared their characteristics with short insert (1 kb) libraries for their ability to identify SVs. Our results suggest that although short insert libraries bear an advantage in identifying small deletions, they do not provide significantly better breakpoint resolution. In contrast, large inserts are superior to short inserts in providing higher physical genome coverage for the same sequencing cost and achieve greater sensitivity, in practice, for the identification of several classes of SVs, such as copy number neutral and complex events. Furthermore, our results confirm that large insert libraries allow for the identification of SVs within repetitive sequences, which cannot be spanned by short inserts. This provides a key advantage in studying rearrangements in cancer, and we show how it can be used in a fusion-point-guided-concatenation algorithm to study focally amplified regions in cancer.},

  abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as a new class of gene expression regulators whose functions influence a myriad of biological processes, from developmental decisions through immune responses and numerous pathologies, including cancer and autoimmunity. miRNAs are small RNA molecules that drive post-transcriptional negative regulation of gene expression by promoting the degradation or translational block of their target mRNAs. Here, we review some of the data relating to the role of miRNAs in the regulation of the B-cell lineage, with a special focus on results obtained in vivo. We start by giving a general overview of miRNA activity, including the issue of target specificity and the experimental approaches more widely used to analyze the function of these molecules. We then go on to discuss the function of miRNAs during B-cell differentiation in the bone marrow and in the periphery as well as during the humoral immune response. Finally, we describe a few examples of the contribution of miRNAs, both as oncogenes and tumor suppressors, to the development of B-cell neoplasias.},

  abstract = {The BCL6 gene codes for a zinc-finger transcription factor and is involved in chromosomal rearrangements in 30-40\% of diffuse large-cell lymphoma (DLCL). These rearrangements cluster within the 5' regulatory region of BCL6 spanning its first non-coding exon. To determine the functional consequences of these alterations, we have analyzed the structure of the rearranged BCL6 alleles and their corresponding RNA and protein species in two DLCL biopsies and one tumor cell line which carried the t(3;14)(q27;q32) translocation involving the BCL6 and immunoglobulin heavy-chain (IgH) loci. In all three cases, the breakpoints were mapped within the IgH switch region and the BCL6 first intron, leading to the juxtaposition of part of the IgH locus upstream and in the same transcriptional orientation to the BCL6 coding exons. An analysis of cDNA clones showed that these recombinations generate chimeric IgH-BCL6 transcripts which initiated from IgH germline transcript promoters (I mu or I gamma 3), but retain a normal BCL6 coding domain. In the tumor cell line, the chimeric I gamma 3-BCL6 allele, but not the germline BCL6 gene, was transcriptionally active and produced a normal BCL6 protein. These findings indicate that t(3;14) translocations alter BCL6 expression by promoter substitution and imply that the consequence of these alterations is the deregulated expression of a normal BCL6 protein.},

A significant proportion of the research involving human cell lines was initiated in China. Paradoxically, the cell lines used in China have never been authenticated. Here, we present a comprehensive survey of cross-contamination in 380 samples from 113 independent sources in China using short tandem repeat profiling methods. High levels of cross-contamination were uncovered (95 of 380, 25\%). Notable false cell lines (e.g., KB and WISH) are still actively used under their false identity and tissue attributions. Most strikingly, 85.51\% of lines established in China were misidentified (59 of 69) and accounted for over half of the misidentifications (59 of 95, 62.11\%). Further, 93.22\% of the contaminants in cell lines established in laboratories of China were HeLa cells or a possible hybrid of HeLa with an unknown cell line. Results from these misidentified lines have been published in thousands of potentially erroneous articles and may have distorted the findings visible to the scientific community.

The two forms of NEIL1 are shown here to have distinct enzymatic properties. The edited form removes thymine glycol from duplex DNA 30 times more slowly than the form encoded in the genome, whereas editing enhances repair of the guanidinohydantoin lesion by NEIL1. In addition, we show that the NEIL1 recoding site is a preferred editing site for the RNA editing adenosine deaminase ADAR1. The edited adenosine resides in an A-C mismatch in a hairpin stem formed by pairing of exon 6 to the immediate upstream intron 5 sequence. As expected for an ADAR1 site, editing at this position is increased in human cells treated with interferon α. These results suggest a unique regulatory mechanism for DNA repair and extend our understanding of the impact of RNA editing.},

Significant disease components include primary myelofibrosis, leukemia, histiocytic sarcoma, and vasculitis. Xist-deficient hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) show aberrant maturation and age-dependent loss. Reconstitution experiments indicate that MPN/MDS and myelofibrosis are of hematopoietic rather than stromal origin. We propose that Xist loss results in X reactivation and consequent genome-wide changes that lead to cancer, thereby causally linking the X chromosome to cancer in mice. Thus, Xist RNA not only is required to maintain XCI but also suppresses cancer in~vivo.},

  abstract = {Positives and negatives of methylated CpG When the DNA bases cytosine and guanine are next to each other, a methyl group is generally added to the pyrimidine, generating a mCpG dinucleotide. This modification alters DNA structure but can also affect function by inhibiting transcription factor (TF) binding. Yin et al. systematically analyzed the effect of CpG methylation on the binding of 542 human TFs (see the Perspective by Hughes and Lambert). In addition to inhibiting binding of some TFs, they found that mCpGs can promote binding of others, particularly TFs involved in development, such as homeodomain proteins. Science, this issue p. eaaj2239; see also p. 489 Structured Abstract INTRODUCTIONNearly all cells in the human body share the same primary genome sequence consisting of four nucleotide bases. One of the bases, cytosine, is commonly modified by methylation of its 5 position in CpG dinucleotides (mCpG). Most CpG dinucleotides in the human genome are methylated, but the level of CpG methylation varies with genetic location (promoter versus gene body), whether genes are active versus silenced, and cell type. Research has shown that the maintenance of a particular cellular state after cell division is dependent on faithful transmission of methylated CpGs, as well as inheritance of the mother cells’ repertoire of transcription factors by the daughter cells. These two mechanisms of epigenetic inheritance are linked to each other; the binding of transcription factors can be affected by cytosine methylation, and cytosine methylation can, in turn, be added or removed by proteins that associate with transcription factors. RATIONALEThe genetic and epigenetic language, which imparts when and where genes are expressed, is understood at a conceptual level. However, a more detailed understanding is needed of the genomic regulatory mechanism by which methylated cytosines affect transcription factor binding. Because cytosine methylation changes DNA structure, it has the potential to affect binding of all transcription factors. However, a systematic analysis of binding of a large collection of transcription factors to all possible DNA sequences has not previously been conducted. RESULTSTo globally characterize the effect of cytosine methylation on transcription factor binding, we systematically analyzed binding specificities of full-length transcription factors and extended DNA binding domains to unmethylated and CpG-methylated DNA by using methylation-sensitive SELEX (systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment). We evaluated binding of 542 transcription factors and identified a large number of previously uncharacterized transcription factor recognition motifs. Binding of most major classes of transcription factors, including bHLH, bZIP, and ETS, was inhibited by mCpG. In contrast, transcription factors such as homeodomain, POU, and NFAT proteins preferred to bind methylated DNA. This class of binding was enriched in factors with central roles in embryonic and organismal development. The observed binding preferences were validated using several orthogonal methods, including bisulfite-SELEX and protein-binding microarrays. In addition, the preference of the pluripotency factor OCT4 to bind to a mCpG-containing motif was confirmed by chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis in mouse embryonic stem cells with low or high levels of CpG methylation (due to deficiency in all enzymes that methylate cytosines or contribute to their removal, respectively). Crystal structure analysis of the homeodomain proteins HOXB13, CDX1, CDX2, and LHX4 revealed three key residues that contribute to the preference of this developmentally important family of transcription factors for mCpG. The preference for binding to mCpG was due to direct hydrophobic interactions with the 5-methyl group of methylcytosine. In contrast, inhibition of binding of other transcription factors to methylated sequences was found to be caused by steric hindrance. CONCLUSIONOur work constitutes a global analysis of the effect of cytosine methylation on DNA binding specificities of human transcription factors. CpG methylation can influence binding of most transcription factors to DNA—in some cases negatively and in others positively. Our finding that many developmentally important transcription factors prefer to bind to mCpG sites can inform future analyses of the role of DNA methylation on cell differentiation, chromatin reprogramming, and transcriptional regulation. {$<$}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="https://d2ufo47lrtsv5s.cloudfront.net/content/sci/356/6337/eaaj2239/F1.medium.gif"/{$>$} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Systematic analysis of the impact of CpG methylation on transcription factor binding.The bottom left panel shows the fraction of transcription factors that prefer methylated (orange) or unmethylated (teal) CpG sites, are affected in multiple ways (yellow), are not affected (green), or do not have a CpG in their motifs (gray), as determined by methylation-sensitive SELEX (top left). The structure and logos on the right highlight how HOXB13 recognizes mCpG (blue shading indicates a CpG affected by methylation). The majority of CpG dinucleotides in the human genome are methylated at cytosine bases. However, active gene regulatory elements are generally hypomethylated relative to their flanking regions, and the binding of some transcription factors (TFs) is diminished by methylation of their target sequences. By analysis of 542 human TFs with methylation-sensitive SELEX (systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment), we found that there are also many TFs that prefer CpG-methylated sequences. Most of these are in the extended homeodomain family. Structural analysis showed that homeodomain specificity for methylcytosine depends on direct hydrophobic interactions with the methylcytosine 5-methyl group. This study provides a systematic examination of the effect of an epigenetic DNA modification on human TF binding specificity and reveals that many developmentally important proteins display preference for mCpG-containing sequences. Genome-scale analysis reveals positive and negative binding of transcription factors to methylated CpG dinucleotides.

  abstract = {CXCR4 expression is critical for localization of centroblasts in the dark zone of germinal centers (GCs), and centrocytes downregulate CXCR4 and thus leave the dark zone to reside in the light zone. However, mechanisms governing CXCR4 downregulation on centrocytes are not known. In this study, we show that the amount of intracellular CXCR4 in centroblasts was similar to that in centrocytes, suggesting differential control of CXCR4 protein expression in these GC B cells. Restimulation of activated B cells with IL-21, which is a major cytokine produced by T follicular helper cells, accelerated CXCR4 internalization by inducing endocytosis-related GRK6 expression. Although CXCR4 expression was downregulated on GC B cells by IL-21 stimulation, CXCR4low centrocytes developed in the spleens of IL-21R–deficient mice, suggesting other mechanisms for downregulation. The level of CD63 (which recruits CXCR4 to late endosome in CD4 T cells) in centrocytes was more than that in centroblasts and was strikingly elevated in activated Bcl6-deficient B cells. Bcl6, a transcriptional repressor, was detected on the chromatin of the CD63 gene in resting B cells, therefore CD63 is a molecular target of Bcl6. Downregulation of CD63 mRNA in activated Bcl6-deficient B cells by small interfering RNA upregulated CXCR4 expression on the B cells. Furthermore, addition of Bcl6 inhibitor to activated B cell cultures increased CD63 mRNA expression in (and downregulated CXCR4 expression on) those activated B cells. Thus, CXCR4 can be downregulated on activated B cells by IL-21–induced endocytosis and CD63-mediated endosomal recruitment, and these mechanisms may contribute to downregulation of CXCR4 on centrocytes.},

  abstract = {The importance of understanding the genetic and biochemical basis of B-cell receptor (BCR) survival signaling in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is underscored by the recent clinical success of agents that target the BCR pathway. DLBCL is composed of multiple distinct molecular subtypes with divergent clinical outcomes. The activated B-cell–like (ABC) subtype is the most aggressive form of DLBCL and is often resistant to standard chemotherapies. ABC DLBCL expresses numerous genes found in antigen-activated B cells, and genetic and pharmacologic studies have demonstrated that ABC DLBCL tumors are addicted to NF-κB activity. The origins of this NF-κB activity remained obscure until RNA interference screens established that the majority of ABC DLBCL cell lines rely on expression of BCR components and downstream signaling effectors for NF-κB activation. Pharmacological inhibition with ibrutinib of Bruton’s tyrosine kinase, a kinase that is required for BCR signaling to engage NF-κB, is selectively toxic for ABC DLBCL tumors; a finding that has now been translated to the clinic. These novel targets not only offer a promising new therapy option for ABC DLBCL, but also demonstrate the value of a deep molecular understanding of oncogenic signaling pathways.},

  abstract = {We have generated mouse models of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) that rely on the cooperation between MYC overexpression and B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) signaling for the initiation and maintenance of B-cell lymphomas. Using these mouse models of NHL, we have focused on the identification of BCR-derived signal effectors that are important for the maintenance of NHL tumors. In the present study, we concentrate on Spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk), a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase required to transduce BCR-dependent signals. Using a genetic approach, we showed that Syk expression is required for the survival of murine NHL-like tumors in vitro and that tumor cells deficient in Syk fail to expand in vivo. In addition, a pharmacologic inhibitor of Syk was able to induce apoptosis of transformed B cells in vitro and led to tumor regression in vivo. Finally, we show that genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of Syk activity in human NHL cell lines are generally consistent with results found in the mouse models, suggesting that targeting Syk may be a viable therapeutic strategy.},

Many genes were reproducibly expressed in restricted developmental "windows," suggesting a structured hierarchy of expression that is relevant for the induction of developmental fates and/or differentiated cell functions. We compared the normal myeloid developmental transcriptome with that of APL cells derived from mice expressing PML-RARalpha under control of the murine cathepsin G locus. While many promyelocyte-specific genes were highly expressed in all APL samples, 116 genes were reproducibly dysregulated in many independent APL samples, including Fos, Jun, Egr1, Tnf, and Vcam1. However, this set of commonly dysregulated genes was expressed normally in preleukemic, early myeloid cells from the same mouse model, suggesting that dysregulation occurs as a "downstream" event during disease progression. These studies suggest that the genetic events that lead to APL progression may converge on common pathways that are important for leukemia pathogenesis.},

  abstract = {miRNAs play important roles in biological processes, such as proliferation, metabolism, differentiation, and apoptosis, whereas altered expression levels contribute to diseases, such as cancers. We identified miRNAs with aberrant expression in Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) and investigated their role in pathogenesis. Small RNA sequencing revealed 84 significantly differentially expressed miRNAs in HL cell lines as compared to germinal center B cells. Three up-regulated miRNAs—miR-23a-3p, miR-24-3p, and miR-27a-3p—were derived from one primary miRNA transcript. Loss-of-function analyses for these miRNAs and their seed family members resulted in decreased growth on miR-24-3p inhibition in three HL cell lines and of miR-27a/b-3p inhibition in one HL cell line. Apoptosis analysis indicated that the effect of miR-24-3p on cell growth is at least in part caused by an increase of apoptotic cells. Argonaute 2 immunoprecipitation revealed 1142 genes consistently targeted by miRNAs in at least three of four HL cell lines. Furthermore, 52 of the 1142 genes were predicted targets of miR-24-3p. Functional annotation analysis revealed a function related to cell growth, cell death, and/or apoptosis for 15 of the 52 genes. Western~blotting of the top five genes showed increased protein levels on miR-24-3p inhibition for CDKN1B/P27kip1 and MYC. In summary, we showed that miR-24-3p is up-regulated in HL and its inhibition impairs cell growth possibly via targeting CDKN1B/P27kip1 and MYC.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST) are highly aggressive sarcomas with variable patient survival and few known prognostically relevant genomic biomarkers. To identify survival-associated genomic biomarkers, we performed high-resolution array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) on a large set of MPNSTs. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Candidate gene alterations identified by aCGH in 38 MPNSTs were validated at the DNA, RNA, and protein levels on these same tumors and an independent set of 87 MPNST specimens. RESULTS: aCGH revealed highly complex copy number alterations, including both previously reported and completely novel loci. Four regions of copy number gain were associated with poor patient survival. Candidate genes in these regions include SOX5 (12p12.1), NOL1 and MLF2 (12p13.31), FOXM1 and FKBP1 (12p13.33), and CDK4 and TSPAN31 (12q14.1). Alterations of these candidate genes and several others of interest (ERBB2, MYC and TP53) were confirmed by at least 1 complementary methodology, including DNA and mRNA quantitative real-time PCR, mRNA expression profiling, and tissue microarray-based fluorescence in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. Multivariate analysis showed that CDK4 gain/amplification and increased FOXM1 protein expression were the most significant independent predictors for poor survival in MPNST patients (P {$<$} 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides new and independently confirmed candidate genes that could serve as genomic biomarkers for overall survival in MPNST patients.},

  abstract = {Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) displays significant heterogeneity with regard to clinical, pathological, and genetic features. Using gene expression profiling, we have delineated 3 molecular subgroups within DLBCL: germinal center B cells (GCB-DLBCL), activated B cells (ABC-DLBCL), and primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (PMBL),while these defined subgroups show characteristic mutation profiles and oncogenic pathways, a small set of cases of DLBCL still remain "unclassifiable" (UC). Burkitt lymphoma (BL) is characterized by the t(8;14)(q24;q32) with distinct morphological and immunophenotypic features. The diagnostic distinction between BL and DLBCL is challenging in a subset of cases that have overlapping morphological, immunohistochemical, and even molecular features, but is crucial for effective therapy. The identification of long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) has added another critical component to cancer biology. LncRNAs are defined as a distinct set of non-protein coding transcripts longer than 200 nucleotides. The functions of a few lncRNAs have been recently elucidated of which some are thought to regulate gene-specific transcription. The goal of the current study was to identify reliable lncRNA signatures for the BL and DLBCL subgroups and evaluate their usefulness as prognostic biomarkers. We examined the expression of lncRNAs from our earlier studies using Affymetrix-HG-U133 plus 2 arrays to distinguish unique gene expression profiles between BL and DLBCL (PMID: 27292966). In the initial analysis, we compared BL (n=77) with DLBCL (n=474) and identified 275 differentially expressed lncRNAs (p=0.005, fold change{$>$}1.5). There was high expression of TCL6 and DDX-AS11 in BL. We confirmed the microarray results for TCL6 and DDX-AS11 by qRT-PCR in a subset of cases. We further tested whether expression of TCL6 and DDX-AS11 was regulated by the MYC oncogene and observed significant downregulation of these transcripts upon CRISPR/cas9 mediated deletion of the MYC promoter in the Raji cell line. We also sought to identify GCB-DLBCL and ABC-DLBCL associated lncRNAs. We observed 36 lncRNAs highly expressed in ABC-DLBCL and 40 lncRNAs highly expressed in GCB-DLBCL (P=0.005, fold change{$>$}1.5). Of the differentially expressed lncRNAs, lnc00487 and DUBR were upregulated in GCB-DLBCL, whereas lnc00944 and FUT8 were upregulated ABC-DLBCL. The observed expression differences were validated in ABC-DLBCL and GCB-DLBCL cell lines. The differentially expressed LncRNAs were also validated in other DLBCL cohorts. LncRNA00487 expression was associated with superior clinical outcome in DLBCL series treated with Rituximab (R)-CHOP (p=0.01), and gene expression and overall survival (OS) were validated in another DLBCL series treated with R-CHOP (PMID:22437443). In the present study, we found that lncRNAs are differentially expressed in aggressive B cell lymphoma and could be useful as diagnostic or prognostic markers. They may play an important role in lymphoma biology and further studies of their functions are warranted. Disclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.},

  abstract = {T cell-dependent B-cell responses decline with age, suggesting defective CD4 T-cell function. CD4 memory T cells from individuals older than 65 y displayed increased and sustained transcription of the dual-specific phosphatase 4 (DUSP4) that shortened expression of CD40-ligand (CD40L) and inducible T-cell costimulator (ICOS) (both P {$<$} 0.001) and decreased production of IL-4, IL-17A, and IL-21 (all P {$<$} 0.001) after in vitro activation. In vivo after influenza vaccination, activated CD4 T cells from elderly individuals had increased DUSP4 transcription (P = 0.002), which inversely correlated with the expression of CD40L (r = 0.65, P = 0.002), ICOS (r = 0.57, P = 0.008), and IL-4 (r = 0.66, P = 0.001). In CD4 KO mice reconstituted with DUSP4 OT-II T cells, DUSP4 had a negative effect on the expansion of antigen-specific B cells (P = 0.003) and the production of ova-specific antibodies (P = 0.03) after immunization. Silencing of DUSP4 in memory CD4 T cells improved CD40L (P {$<$} 0.001), IL-4 (P = 0.007), and IL-21 (P = 0.04) expression significantly more in the elderly than young adults. Consequently, the ability of CD4 memory T cells to support B-cell differentiation that was impaired in the elderly (P = 0.004) was restored. Our data suggest that increased DUSP4 expression in activated T cells in the elderly in part accounts for defective adaptive immune responses.},

Transcription of the c-myc gene is repressed by Blimp-1 during B-cell differentiation. In this study, we have explored the mechanism by which Blimp-1 represses transcription by using Gal4-fusion protein assays and assays in which Blimp-1 represses the natural c-mycpromoter. The results show that Blimp-1 represses the c-mycpromoter by an active mechanism that is independent of the adjacently bound activator YY1. Blimp-1 contains two regions that independently associate with histone deacetylase (HDAC) and endogenous Blimp-1 in nuclear extracts binds in vitro to the c-myc Blimp-1 site in a complex containing HDAC. The functional importance of recruiting HDAC for Blimp-1-dependent repression of c-myctranscription is supported by two experiments. First, the HDAC inhibitor tricostatin A inhibits Blimp-1-dependent repression in cotransfection assays. Second, a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay shows that expression of Blimp-1 causes deacetylation of histone H3 associated with the c-myc promoter, and this deacetylation depends on the Blimp-1 binding site in the c-myc promoter.},

Here, we perform extensive multiomic analyses to identify an OTX2 regulatory network that controls Group 3 medulloblastoma cell fate. OTX2 silencing modulates the repressive chromatin landscape, decreases levels of PRC2 complex genes and increases the expression of neurodevelopmental transcription factors including PAX3 and PAX6. Expression of PAX3 and PAX6 is significantly lower in Group 3 medulloblastoma patients and is correlated with reduced survival, yet only PAX3 inhibits self-renewal in vitro and increases survival in vivo. Single cell RNA sequencing of Group 3 medulloblastoma tumorspheres demonstrates expression of an undifferentiated progenitor program observed in primary tumors and characterized by translation/elongation factor genes.

These alterations may have no phenotypic effect, account for adaptive traits or can underlie disease. We have compiled published high-quality data on healthy individuals of various ethnicities to construct an updated CNV map of the human genome. Depending on the level of stringency of the map, we estimated that 4.8–9.5\% of the genome contributes to CNV and found approximately 100 genes that can be completely deleted without producing apparent phenotypic consequences. This map will aid the interpretation of new CNV findings for both clinical and research applications.},

  abstract = {Interleukin-21 (IL-21) is a type I cytokine that modulates functions of T, B, natural killer (NK), and myeloid cells. The IL-21 receptor (IL-21R) is closely related to the IL-2 receptor β chain and is capable of transducing signals through its dimerization with the common cytokine receptor γ chain (γc), the protein whose expression is defective in humans with X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency. To clarify the molecular basis of IL-21 actions, we investigated the role of tyrosine residues in the IL-21R cytoplasmic domain. Simultaneous mutation of all 6 tyrosines greatly diminished IL-21–mediated proliferation, whereas retention of tyrosine 510 (Y510) allowed full proliferation. Y510 efficiently mediated IL-21–induced phosphorylation of Stat1 and Stat3, but not of Stat5, and CD8+ T cells from Stat1/Stat3 double knock-out mice exhibited decreased proliferation in response to IL-21 + IL-15. In addition, IL-21 weakly induced phosphorylation of Shc and Akt, and consistent with this, specific inhibitors of the MAPK and PI3K pathways inhibited IL-21–mediated proliferation. Collectively, these data indicate the involvement of the Jak-STAT, MAPK, and PI3K pathways in IL-21 signaling.},

  abstract = {Epigenetic regulation of gene enhancer elements is important for establishing and maintaining the identity of cells. Gene enhancer elements are thought to exist in either active or poised states distinguishable by chromatin features, but a complete understanding of the regulation of enhancers is lacking. Here, by using mouse embryonic stem cells and their differentiated derivatives, as well as terminally differentiated cells, we report the coexistence of multiple, defined classes of enhancers that serve distinct cellular functions. Specifically, we found that active enhancers can be subclassified based on varying levels of H3K4me1, H3K27ac, and H3K36me3 and the pSer2/5 forms of RNA polymerase II. The abundance of these histone modifications positively correlates with the expression of associated genes and cellular functions consistent with the identity of the cell type. Poised enhancers can also be subclassified based on presence or absence of H3K27me3 and H3K9me3, conservation, genomic location, expression levels of associated genes, and predicted function of associated genes. These findings not only refine the repertoire of histone modifications at both active and poised gene enhancer elements but also raise the possibility that enhancers associated with distinct cellular functions are partitioned based on specific combinations of histone modifications.},

Most CLL tumour cells are inert and arrested in G0/G1 of the cell cycle and there is only a small proliferative compartment; however, the progressive accumulation of malignant cells will ultimately lead to symptomatic disease. Pathogenic mechanisms have been elucidated that involve multiple external (for example, microenvironmental stimuli and antigenic drive) and internal (genetic and epigenetic) events that are crucial in the transformation, progression and evolution of CLL. Our growing understanding of CLL biology is allowing the translation of targets and biological classifiers into clinical practice.},

  abstract = {Diffuse midline gliomas (DMGs) are pediatric high-grade brain tumors in the thalamus, midbrain, or pons; the latter subgroup are termed diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas (DIPG). The brain stem location of these tumors limits the clinical management of DIPG, resulting in poor outcomes for patients. A heterozygous, somatic point mutation in one of two genes coding for the noncanonical histone H3.3 is present in most DIPG tumors. This dominant mutation in the H3-3A gene results in replacement of lysine 27 with methionine (K27M) and causes a global reduction of trimethylation on K27 of all wild-type histone H3 proteins, which is thought to be a driving event in gliomagenesis. In this study, we designed and systematically screened 2'-O-methoxyethyl phosphorothioate antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) that direct RNase H-mediated knockdown of H3-3A mRNA. We identified a lead ASO that effectively reduced H3-3A mRNA and H3.3K27M protein and restored global H3K27 trimethylation in patient-derived neurospheres. We then tested the lead ASO in two mouse models of DIPG: an immunocompetent mouse model using transduced mutant human H3-3A cDNA and an orthotopic xenograft with patient-derived cells. In both models, ASO treatment restored K27 trimethylation of histone H3 proteins and reduced tumor growth, promoted neural stem cell differentiation into astrocytes, neurons, and oligodendrocytes, and increased survival. These results demonstrate the involvement of the H3.3K27M oncohistone in tumor maintenance, confirm the reversibility of the aberrant epigenetic changes it promotes, and provide preclinical proof of concept for DMG antisense therapy.},

  abstract = {High-grade gliomas (HGG) are deadly diseases for both adult and pediatric patients. Recently, it has been shown that neuronal activity promotes progression of multiple subgroups of HGG. However, epigenetic mechanisms that govern this process remain elusive. Here we report that the chromatin remodeler CHD2 regulates neuron-glioma interactions in diffuse midline glioma (DMG) characterized by onco-histone H3.1K27M. Depletion of CHD2 in H3.1K27M DMG cells compromises cell viability and neuron-to-glioma synaptic connections in vitro, neuron-induced proliferation of H3.1K27M DMG cells in vitro and in vivo, activity-dependent calcium transients in vivo, and extends the survival of H3.1K27M DMG-bearing mice. Mechanistically, CHD2 coordinates with the transcription factor FOSL1 to control the expression of axon-guidance and synaptic genes in H3.1K27M DMG cells. Together, our study reveals a mechanism whereby CHD2 controls the intrinsic gene program of the H3.1K27M DMG subtype, which in turn regulates the tumor growth-promoting interactions of glioma cells with neurons.},

  abstract = {Inactivating mutations of the CREBBP acetyltransferase are highly frequent in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and follicular lymphoma (FL), the two most common germinal center (GC)–derived cancers. However, the role of CREBBP inactivation in lymphomagenesis remains unclear. Here, we show that CREBBP regulates enhancer/super-enhancer networks with central roles in GC/post-GC cell fate decisions, including genes involved in signal transduction by the B-cell receptor and CD40 receptor, transcriptional control of GC and plasma cell development, and antigen presentation. Consistently, Crebbp-deficient B cells exhibit enhanced response to mitogenic stimuli and perturbed plasma cell differentiation. Although GC-specific loss of Crebbp was insufficient to initiate malignant transformation, compound Crebbp-haploinsufficient/BCL2-transgenic mice, mimicking the genetics of FL and DLBCL, develop clonal lymphomas recapitulating the features of the human diseases. These findings establish CREBBP as a haploinsufficient tumor-suppressor gene in GC B cells and provide insights into the mechanisms by which its loss contributes to lymphomagenesis. SIGNIFICANCE: Loss-of-function mutations of CREBBP are common and early lesions in FL and DLBCL, suggesting a prominent role in lymphoma initiation. Our studies identify the cellular program by which reduced CREBBP dosage facilitates malignant transformation, and have direct implications for targeted lymphoma therapy based on drugs affecting CREBBP-mediated chromatin acetylation.

However, the functional consequences of these mutations and their role in lymphomagenesis are unknown. Here we show that FL- and DLBCL-associated KMT2D mutations impair KMT2D enzymatic activity, leading to diminished global H3K4 methylation in germinal-center (GC) B cells and DLBCL cells. Conditional deletion of Kmt2d early during B cell development, but not after initiation of the GC reaction, results in an increase in GC B cells and enhances B cell proliferation in mice. Moreover, genetic ablation of Kmt2d in mice overexpressing Bcl2 increases the incidence of GC-derived lymphomas resembling human tumors. These findings suggest that KMT2D acts as a tumor suppressor gene whose early loss facilitates lymphomagenesis by remodeling the epigenetic landscape of the cancer precursor cells. Eradication of KMT2D-deficient cells may thus represent a rational therapeutic approach for targeting early tumorigenic events.},

Lung cancer, which is one of the most commonmalignancies, has become the most lethal among all cancers. In certain situations, lung cancer tissues may be the only resource available for forensic analysis. Therefore, evaluating the reliability of STR markers in lung cancer tissues is required to avoid false exclusions. In this study, 75 lung cancer tissue samples were examined to evaluate the reliability of various STR markers. Out of the 75 examined samples, 24 of the cancerous samples (32\%) showed genetic alterations on at least one STR loci, totaling 55 times. The most common type of STR variation was a partial loss of heterozygosity, with the D5S818 loci having the highest variation frequency and no alterations detected on the D2S441 and Penta E loci. Moreover, STR variation frequencies were shown to increase with an increased patient age and increased clinical and pathological characteristics, thus an older patient with an advanced stage of progression exhibited a higher variation frequency. Overall, this study provides forensic scientists with further insight into STR analysis relating to lung cancer tissue.},

The writers of these modifications play important roles in normal development and their mutation or misregulation is linked with both genetic disorders and various cancers. Readers of these marks contain protein domains that allow their recruitment to chromatin. Interestingly, writers often contain domains which can read chromatin marks, allowing the reinforcement of modifications through a positive feedback loop or inhibition of their activity by other modifications. We discuss how such positive reinforcement can result in chromatin states that are robust and can be epigenetically maintained through cell division. We describe the implications of these regulatory systems in relation to modifications including H3K4me3, H3K79me3, and H3K36me3 that are associated with active genes and H3K27me3 and H3K9me3 that have been linked to transcriptional repression. We also review the crosstalk between active and repressive modifications, illustrated by the interplay between the Polycomb and Trithorax histone-modifying proteins, and discuss how this may be important in defining gene expression states during development.},

Gene-expression profiling and phenotypic studies suggest that CLL is probably derived from CD5+ B cells similar to those found in the blood of healthy adults. Next-generation sequencing has revealed recurrent genetic lesions that are implicated in CLL pathogenesis and/or disease progression. The biology of CLL is entwined with its microenvironment, in which accessory cells can promote leukemia cell growth and/or survival. Recently, much attention has been focused on the CLL B cell receptor (BCR) and on chemokine receptors that enable CLL cells to home to lymphoid tissues and to establish the leukemia microenvironment. Agents that can interfere with BCR signaling or chemokine–receptor signaling, or that target surface antigens selectively expressed on CLL cells, promise to have significant therapeutic benefit in patients with this disease.},

Malignancies derived from mature B cells constitute the majority of leukemias and lymphomas. These malignancies often maintain the characteristics of the normal B cells that they are derived from, a feature that is frequently used in their diagnosis. The role of microRNAs in mature B cells is largely unknown. Through concomitant microRNA and mRNA profiling, we demonstrate a potential regulatory role for microRNAs at every stage of the mature B-cell differentiation process. In addition, we have experimentally identified a direct role for the microRNA regulation of key transcription factors in B-cell differentiation: LMO2 and PRDM1 (Blimp1). We also profiled the microRNA of B-cell tumors derived from diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, Burkitt lymphoma, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. We found that, in contrast to many other malignancies, common B-cell malignancies do not down-regulate microRNA expression. Although these tumors could be distinguished from each other with use of microRNA expression, each tumor type maintained the expression of the lineage-specific microRNAs. Expression of these lineage-specific microRNAs could correctly predict the lineage of B-cell malignancies in more than 95\% of the cases. Thus, our data demonstrate that microRNAs may be important in maintaining the mature B-cell phenotype in normal and malignant B cells.},

There are two main pathways of apoptosis: the extrinsic pathway and the intrinsic pathway. It is worth noting that the intrinsic pathway, rather than the extrinsic pathway, appears to be the key mediator of impaired apoptosis in CLL as a result of B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) upregulation. One subclass of pro-apoptotic members within the Bcl-2 family are Bcl-2 homology 3 (BH3)-only proteins. They can regulate directly and/or indirectly the remaining Bcl-2 proteins to endanger mitochondria and induce apoptosis.

Proteoglycan serglycin (SRGN) proteins are involved in tumor metastasis, but their role in TNBC has not yet been elucidated. This study investigates the SRGN gene expression and how it regulates TGFβ2 and the downstream signaling of TGFβ2 in TNBC cells and tissues. Our results show that SRGN mRNA and protein expression levels were significantly higher in TNBC cell lines and tumor tissues than that in non-TNBC cells and tissues. We inhibited SRGN expression and protein secretion using shRNA and we observed this inhibited the invasive motility of TNBC cancer cells in vitro and metastasis of TNBC cancer cells in vivo. SRGN protein treatment increased the expression and secretion of transforming growth factor-β2 (TGFβ2) by activating CD44/CREB1 signaling and promoted epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in TNBC cells. Moreover, TGFβ2 treatment increased the mRNA and protein expression of the SRGN gene by activating Smad3 to target the SRGN relative promoter domain in TNBC cells. Our findings demonstrate that SRGN interacts with TGFβ2 which regulates TNBC metastasis via the autocrine and paracrine routes. SRGN could serve as a potential target for development of agents or therapeutics for the TNBC.},

  abstract = {Advanced-stage cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) is usually a fatal malignancy despite optimal use of currently available treatments. In this preclinical study of novel CTCL therapy, we performed in vitro and ex vivo experiments to determine the efficacy of combination treatment with a panel of BET bromodomain inhibitors (BETi) (JQ1, OTX015, CPI-0610, I-BET762) and HDAC inhibitors (HDACi) (SAHA/Vorinostat, Romidepsin). BETi/HDACi combinations were synergistic (combination index {$<$}1) against cell viability and induced G0/G1 cell cycle arrest. Apoptosis was uniformly enhanced. From a mechanistic standpoint, proliferative drivers c-Myc, Cyclin D1, NFkB, and IL-15Rα were reduced. Inhibitory CDKN1A was increased. CDKN1B, IL-7R, IL-17Rα, STAT3, and STAT5 alterations varied. There were significant increases in extrinsic apoptotic pathway death receptors and ligands (FasL, DR4, DR5, TRAIL, and TNFR1). At clinically tolerable levels of single agents, Romidepsin (1 nM)\,+\,OTX015 (125 nM) induced the greatest apoptosis (60\%\_80\%) at 96\,hours. Ex vivo studies of leukemic CTCL cells obtained from patients with Sezary syndrome also showed higher levels of apoptosis (about 60\%-90\%) in response to combination treatments relative to single agents. In contrast, combination treatment of normal CD4+ T cells induced only minimal apoptosis ({$<$}10\%). Our findings show that the mechanism of action of BETi/HDACi therapy in CTCL involves induction of both cell cycle arrest and apoptosis with reduced proliferative drivers and enhanced expression of apoptotic extrinsic pathway death receptors and ligands. Relative to single agents, the superior anti-CTCL effects of BETi/HDACi combinations in vitro and ex vivo provide a rationale for clinical trials exploring their efficacy as therapy for CTCL.},

  abstract = {Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies are yielding ever-higher volumes of human genome sequence data. Given this large amount of data, it has become both a possibility and a priority to determine how disease-causing single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) detected within gene regulatory regions (rSNPs) exert their effects on gene expression. Recently, several studies have explored whether disease-causing polymorphisms have attributes that can distinguish them from those that are neutral, attaining moderate success at discriminating between functional and putatively neutral regulatory SNPs. Here, we have extended this work by assessing the utility of both SNP-based features (those associated only with the polymorphism site and the surrounding DNA) and Gene-based features (those derived from the associated gene in whose regulatory region the SNP lies) in the identification of functional regulatory polymorphisms involved in either monogenic or complex disease. Gene-based features were found to be capable of both augmenting and enhancing the utility of SNP-based features in the prediction of known regulatory mutations. Adopting this approach, we achieved an AUC of 0.903 for predicting regulatory SNPs. Finally, our tool predicted 225 new regulatory SNPs with a high degree of confidence, with 105 of the 225 falling into linkage disequilibrium blocks of reported disease-associated GWAS SNPs.},

  abstract = {B cell formation, development, and differentiation are complex processes regulated by several mechanisms. Recently, there has been growing evidence indicating that microRNAs are important for normal B cell lineage development. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNA molecules, about 20-22 nucleotide in length, that play an important role in regulating gene expression. They pair with specific messenger RNAs (mRNAs), resulting in mRNAs translational repression or degradation. Here, we review current research about the function of miRNAs in the aspects of B-cell physiology and pathology. We start by introducing the process of miRNA biogenesis. We will then focus on the role of miRNAs during B cell lineage commitment and development in the bone marrow, followed by a discussion of miRNAs’ role in subsequent peripheral B cell activation, proliferation, and final differentiation (including B cell central tolerance and autoimmunity). We list and describe several examples to illustrate miRNAs’ role in the development of B-cell lymphoma, both as oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. Finally, we delineate the potential value of miRNAs in diagnosing B cell lymphoma, predicting clinical outcomes, and modulating the efficiency of anticancer treatments. Despite the vast amount of research conducted on miRNAs in recent years, it is still necessary to increase and further strengthen studies on miRNAs and their targets to promote a better understanding on B cell development and as a result, construct more effective treatments against B cell disease.},

Here, we generated transgenic mice ubiquitously overexpressing LYL1 using a construct expressing full-length cDNA driven by a human elongation factor 1 promoter. Four independent lines exhibiting high LYL1 expression were established. Of these transgenic mice, 96\% displayed loss of hair with a short kinked tail. Furthermore, 30\% of them developed malignant lymphoma, with an average latent period of 352 days. In these mice, histological examination revealed tumor cell infiltration in multiple organs and immunohistochemical analysis showed that the infiltrated tumor cells were either CD3 or CD45R/B220-positive; fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis indicated that each tumor consisted either of mainly CD4, CD8 double-positive T cells or mature B cells; the clonality of LYL1-induced lymphoma was confirmed by T-cell receptor rearrangement and immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene rearrangement analyses. Mammalian two-hybrid analysis and luciferase assay suggested that excess LYL1 blocked the dimerization of E2A and thus inhibited the regulatory activity of E2A on the CD4 promoter. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction results showed that the expression of certain E2A/HEB target genes was downregulated. Taken together, our results provide direct evidence that aberrant expression of LYL1 plays a role in lymphomagenesis.},

By examining Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs), we identified four EBV oncoproteins and five EBV-activated NF-κB subunits co-occupying ∼1,800 enhancer sites. Of these, 187 had markedly higher and broader histone H3K27ac signals, characteristic of super-enhancers, and were designated “EBV super-enhancers.” EBV super-enhancer-associated genes included the MYC and BCL2 oncogenes, which enable LCL proliferation and survival. EBV super-enhancers were enriched for B cell transcription factor motifs and had high co-occupancy of STAT5 and NFAT transcription factors (TFs). EBV super-enhancer-associated genes were more highly expressed than other LCL genes. Disrupting EBV super-enhancers by the bromodomain inhibitor JQ1 or conditionally inactivating an EBV oncoprotein or NF-κB decreased MYC or BCL2 expression and arrested LCL growth. These findings provide insight into mechanisms of EBV-induced lymphoproliferation and identify potential therapeutic interventions.},

  abstract = {The NOTCH gene was identified approximately 110 years ago. Classical studies have revealed that NOTCH signaling is an evolutionarily conserved pathway. NOTCH receptors undergo three cleavages and translocate into the nucleus to regulate the transcription of target genes. NOTCH signaling deeply participates in the development and homeostasis of multiple tissues and organs, the aberration of which results in cancerous and noncancerous diseases. However, recent studies indicate that the outcomes of NOTCH signaling are changeable and highly dependent on context. In terms of cancers, NOTCH signaling can both promote and inhibit tumor development in various types of cancer. The overall performance of NOTCH-targeted therapies in clinical trials has failed to meet expectations. Additionally, NOTCH mutation has been proposed as a predictive biomarker for immune checkpoint blockade therapy in many cancers. Collectively, the NOTCH pathway needs to be integrally assessed with new perspectives to inspire discoveries and applications. In this review, we focus on both classical and the latest findings related to NOTCH signaling to illustrate the history, architecture, regulatory mechanisms, contributions to physiological development, related diseases, and therapeutic applications of the NOTCH pathway. The contributions of NOTCH signaling to the tumor immune microenvironment and cancer immunotherapy are also highlighted. We hope this review will help not only beginners but also experts to systematically and thoroughly understand the NOTCH signaling pathway.},

  abstract = {NG2-expressing glia (NG2 cells, polydendrocytes) appear in the embryonic brain, expand perinatally, and persist widely throughout the gray and white matter of the mature central nervous system. We have previously reported that NG2 cells generate oligodendrocytes in both gray and white matter and a subset of protoplasmic astrocytes in the gray matter of the ventral forebrain and spinal cord. To investigate the temporal changes in NG2 cell fate, we generated NG2creER™BAC transgenic mice, in which tamoxifen-inducible Cre is expressed in NG2 cells. Cre induction at embryonic day 16.5, postnatal day (P) 2, P30 and P60 in mice that were double transgenic for NG2creER™BAC and the Cre reporter revealed that NG2 cells in the postnatal brain generate only NG2 cells or oligodendrocytes, whereas NG2 cells in the embryonic brain generate protoplasmic astrocytes in the gray matter of the ventral forebrain in addition to oligodendrocytes and NG2 cells. Analysis of cell clusters from single NG2 cells revealed that more than 80\% of the NG2 cells in the P2 brain give rise to clusters consisting exclusively of oligodendrocytes, whereas the majority of the NG2 cells in the P60 brain generate clusters that contain only NG2 cells or a mixture of oligodendrocytes and NG2 cells. Furthermore, live cell imaging of single NG2 cells from early postnatal brain slices revealed that NG2 cells initially divide symmetrically to produce two daughter NG2 cells and that differentiation into oligodendrocytes occurred after 2-3 days.},

  abstract = {During mammalian development, differences in chromatin state coincide with cellular differentiation and reflect changes in the gene regulatory landscape1. In the developing brain, cell fate specification and topographic identity are important for defining cell identity2 and confer selective vulnerabilities to neurodevelopmental disorders3. Here, to identify cell-type-specific chromatin accessibility patterns in the developing human brain, we used a single-cell assay for transposase accessibility by sequencing (scATAC-seq) in primary tissue samples from~the human forebrain. We applied unbiased analyses to identify genomic loci that undergo extensive cell-type- and brain-region-specific changes in accessibility during neurogenesis, and an integrative analysis to predict cell-type-specific candidate regulatory elements. We found that cerebral organoids recapitulate most putative cell-type-specific enhancer accessibility patterns but lack many cell-type-specific open chromatin regions that are found in vivo. Systematic comparison of chromatin accessibility across brain regions revealed unexpected diversity among neural progenitor cells in the cerebral cortex and implicated retinoic acid signalling in the specification of neuronal lineage identity in the prefrontal cortex. Together, our results reveal the important contribution of chromatin state to the emerging patterns of cell type diversity and cell fate specification and provide a blueprint for evaluating the fidelity and robustness of cerebral organoids as a model for cortical development.},

  abstract = {Expression of the complement-regulatory proteins (CRP) CD46, CD55 and CD59 represents a strategy used by tumor cells to evade complement-dependent cell cytoxicity stimulated by monoclonal antibodies. We have isolated two single-chain variable fragments (scFv) to CD55 and CD59 from a human phage-display library and from these scFv we have produced two miniantibodies (MB), MB-55 (against CD55) and MB-59 (against CD59), containing the human hinge–CH2–CH3 domains of IgG1. The specificity of the two MB for the corresponding CRP was assessed by ELISA using purified CD46, CD55 and CD59. MB-55 and MB-59 neutralized the inhibitory activity of CD55 and CD59, respectively, restoring the complement-mediated lysis of sheep and guinea pig erythrocytes that was otherwise inhibited by the two CRP. FACS analysis revealed binding of MB-55 and MB-59 to the lymphoma cell line Karpas 422. The two MB induced a two-fold increase in the complement-dependent killing of these cells stimulated by Rituximab, a chimeric anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody. Transfection of HEK293T cells with vectors encoding MB-55 or MB-59 markedly reduced the expression of CD55 and CD59. We conclude that the human antibodies MB-55 and MB-59 may represent a therapeutic tool to increase the complement-dependent killing activity of Rituximab in the treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.},

  abstract = {CD38 and CD49d are associated negative prognosticators in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Despite evidence that both molecules are involved in interactions occurring between CLL and normal cells in the context of CLL-involved tissues, a functional link is still missing. Using gene expression profiles comparing CD38+CD49d+ versus CD38−CD49d− CLL cells, we showed overexpression of the CCL3 and CCL4 chemokines in cells from the former group. These chemokines were also up-regulated by CD38 signals in CLL; moreover, CCL3 was expressed by CLL cells from bone marrow biopsies (BMB) of CD38+CD49d+ but not CD38−CD49d− cases. High levels of CCR1 and, to a lesser extent, CCR5, the receptors for CCL3 and CCL4, were found in CLL-derived monocyte-macrophages. Consistently, CCL3 increased monocyte migration, and CD68+ macrophage infiltration was particularly high in BMB from CD38+CD49d+ CLL. Conditioned media from CCL3-stimulated macrophages induced endothelial cells to express vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), the CD49d ligand, likely through tumor necrosis factor α overproduction. These effects were apparent in BMB from CD38+CD49d+ CLL, where lymphoid infiltrates were characterized by a prominent meshwork of VCAM-1+ stromal/endothelial cells. Lastly, CD49d engagement by VCAM-1 transfectants increased viability of CD38+CD49d+ CLL cells. Altogether, CD38 and CD49d can be thought of as parts of a consecutive chain of events ultimately leading to improved survival of CLL cells. [Cancer Res 2009;69(9):4001–9]},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Pediatric-type diffuse high-grade glioma (pHGG) is the most frequent malignant brain tumor in children and can be subclassified into multiple entities. Fusion genes activating the MET receptor tyrosine kinase often occur in infant-type hemispheric glioma (IHG) but also in other pHGG and are associated with devastating morbidity and mortality. METHODS: To identify new treatment options, we established and characterized two novel orthotopic mouse models harboring distinct MET fusions. These included an immunocompetent, murine allograft model and patient-derived orthotopic xenografts (PDOX) from a MET-fusion IHG patient who failed conventional therapy and targeted therapy with cabozantinib. With these models, we analyzed the efficacy and pharmacokinetic properties of three MET inhibitors, capmatinib, crizotinib and cabozantinib, alone or combined with radiotherapy. RESULTS: Capmatinib showed superior brain pharmacokinetic properties and greater in vitro and in vivo efficacy than cabozantinib or crizotinib in both models. The PDOX models recapitulated the poor efficacy of cabozantinib experienced by the patient. In contrast, capmatinib extended survival and induced long-term progression-free survival when combined with radiotherapy in two complementary mouse models. Capmatinib treatment increased radiation-induced DNA double-strand breaks and delayed their repair. CONCLUSIONS: We comprehensively investigated the combination of MET inhibition and radiotherapy as a novel treatment option for MET-driven pHGG. Our seminal preclinical data package includes pharmacokinetic characterization, recapitulation of clinical outcomes, coinciding results from multiple complementing in vivo studies, and insights into molecular mechanism underlying increased efficacy. Taken together, we demonstrate the groundbreaking efficacy of capmatinib and radiation as a highly promising concept for future clinical trials.},
