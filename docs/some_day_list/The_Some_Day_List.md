# The "some day" List

Stuff that I'd like to get to at some point that isn't important enough to prioritize *now*.

## Development
- Cram convenience/plotting functions into a R package for ease of maintenance/sharing.
- Find a way to summarize lots of GO terms into a human interpretable output that is both succinct and doesn't suck.
	- Fine tune an LLM and use RAG with the term descriptions?
	- Preferably from within R without relying on external setup to run models.
- Write up CRISPRball for JOSS or such.
- Make IBET more performant.
	- Avoid complete re-plotting when adding labels.
	- Add option to add labels automatically on highlighted gene(sets).

## Data Processing
- Typical `params.yaml` files for nf-core pipelines pointing to our reference data rather than having that crammed into configs.
- Template notebooks for ATAC-seq.
- Template notebooks for ChIP-seq/CnR.

## Organization
- List all interactive reports/apps on wiki.
